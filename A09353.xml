            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, there are at this day foure ſeuerall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the order of Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Predeſtination.</p>
            <p>The firſt, is of the old and newe Pelagians; who place the cauſe of Gods Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in man: in that they hold, that God did ordeine men either to life or death, according as he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, that they would by their naturall free will, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reiect or receiue grace offered.</p>
            <p>The ſecond of them, who (of ſome) are termed Lutherans; which teach, that God foreſeeing how all mankinde being ſhut vp vnder vnbeliefe, would therfore reiect grace offered, did hereupon purpoſe to chooſe ſome to ſaluation of his meer mercy with out any reſpect of their faith or good works, and the reſt to reiect being moued to do this, becauſe he did eternallye foreſee that they would reiect his grace offered them in the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>The third, of Sempelagian Papiſts, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Gods Predeſtination, partlye to mercye, and partly to mens foreſeen preparations and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous workes.</p>
            <p>The fourth, of ſuch as teach, that the cauſe of the execution of Gods Predeſtination in his mercye in Chriſt, in them which are ſaued, and in them which periſh, the fall and corruption of man: yet ſo, as that the decree and eternal counſell of God, concerning them both, hath not any cauſe beſide his will and
<pb facs="tcp:5274:3"/>
pleaſure. Of theſe foure opinions, the three former, I haue laboured to oppugne as erronious; and to maintaine the laſt, as being a trueth which wil beare weight in the ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>A further diſcourſe wherof, here I make bold to offer to thy godly conſideration: in reading wherof regard not ſo much the thing it ſelfe, penned verye ſlenderly, as mine intent and affection: who deſire among the reſt to caſt my myte into the treaſurie of the Church of England; and for want of gold, pearle and precious ſtone, to bring a Rammes Skinne or twaine, and a little Goates haire, to the building of the Lords Tabernacle. <hi>Exod. 35.23.</hi>

            <p>The Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt graunt that according to the ritches of his glory, thou maieſt be ſtrengthened by his Spirite in the inner man, that Chriſt may dwel in thy hart by faith, to the end that thou being rooted and grounded in loue, maieſt be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth and length and deapth, and height thereof: and to know the loue of Chriſt which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge, that thou maiſt be filled with all fulnes of God.

            </p>
            <p>The firſt title of God, declareth his Nature, the ſecond his Perſons.</p>
            <p>The nature of God, is his liuely and moſt perfect eſſence.</p>
            <p>The perfection of the nature of God, is his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute conſtitution, by the which he is wholye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete within himſelfe. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.13. <hi>I am that I am,</hi> Act. 17.24. <hi>God that made the worlde, and all thinges that are therein, ſeeing that he is Lord of heauen and earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with handes, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is worſhipped with mens handes.</hi> As though he needed any thing, <hi>ſeeing he giueth to all life &amp; breath and all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The perfection of his nature is either the Simple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or the infinitenes thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſimplenes of his nature, is that by which he is voide of all Logicall relation. He hath not in him, ſubiect or adiunct. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.26. <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he giuen to the Sonne to haue life</hi> in him ſelfe: Conferred with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>I am the way, the trueth, and the</hi> Life. 1. Ioh. 1.7. <hi>But if we walk in light as he is in</hi> light, conferred with the 5. <hi>God is light &amp; in him is no darknes.</hi> Hence it is manifeſt, that to haue Life, and to be Life: to be in Light, and to be Light: in God are all one. Neither is God ſubiect to generalitie or ſpecialitie: whole, or partes: matter,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:4"/>
or that which is made of matter: for ſo ther ſhold be in God diuers things, and one more perfect then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: therfore whatſoeuer is in God, is his eſſence. and all that he is, he is by his eſſence.</p>
            <p>Hence it is manifeſt, that the Nature of God, is immutable and Spirituall.</p>
            <p>Gods immutabilitie of nature, is that by which he is void of all compoſition, diuiſion, and change. Iam. 1.17. <hi>With God there is no variablenes nor ſhadow of changing.</hi> Mal. 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord and am not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods nature is ſpiritual in that it is corporal, and therefore inuiſible. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.24. <hi>God is a ſpirite.</hi> 2. Cor. 3.17. <hi>The Lord is the ſpirite.</hi> 1. Tim. 1.17. <hi>To the King eternall, immortall, inuiſible, only wiſe God be glorye and honour for euer and euer.</hi> Coloſſ. 1.15. <hi>Who is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the inuiſible God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The infinitenes of God is two folde: his Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and exceeding greatnes.</p>
            <p>Gods eternitie, is that by which he is without beginning and ending. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.2. <hi>Before the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were made, and before thou hadſt formed the earth and the round worlde, euen from euerlaſting to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting thou art our God.</hi> Reuel. 1.8. <hi>I am</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mega, <hi>that is, the beginning and ending, ſaith the Lord, Which is, which was, and which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods exceeding greatnes, is that by which his incomprehenſible nature is euerye where preſent, both within and without the worlde. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.3. <hi>Great is the Lord &amp; worthy to be praiſed, and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is incomprehenſible.</hi> 1. King. 8.27. <hi>Is it true indeede
<pb facs="tcp:5274:5"/>
that God will dwell on the earth? beholde the heauens, and the heauens of heauens are not able to containe thee: how much leſſe is this houſe that I haue built?</hi> Iere. 23.23. <hi>Doo not I fill the heauen and earth ſaith the Lord?</hi> Hence it is plaine: firſte, that he is onelye one, and indiviſible, not many. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.5. <hi>One Lord, one faith, one Baptiſme, one God and Father of all.</hi> Deut. 4.35. <hi>Vnto thee it was ſhewed, that thou mighteſt know that the Lord he is God, and that there is none but he alone.</hi> 1. Cor. 8.4. <hi>We know that an Idole is nothing in the worlde, and that there is none other God but one.</hi> And there can be but one thing infinite in nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that God is the knower of the heart. For nothing is hidden from that nature, which is within al things and without all things, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in nothing, nor excluded from anye thing. Becauſe 1. <hi>King.</hi> 28.9. <hi>The Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and vnderſtandeth euery woork of the minde.</hi> Pſal. 139.1.2. <hi>Thou knoweſt my ſitting downe and my riſing vp, thou vnderſtandeſt my cogitation a farre off.</hi>

               <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Of the life of God.</head>
            <p>HItherto haue we ſpoken of the perfection of Gods nature. Now followeth the life of God, by which the Diuine Nature is in perpetuall action, liuing and mouing it ſelfe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.2. <hi>My ſoule thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth for God, euen for the liuing God: when ſhal I come and appeare before the preſence of God?</hi> Heb. 3.12. <hi>See that there be not at any time in any of you an euill hart to depart from the liuing God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The deuine nature is eſpeciallye in perpetuall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
<pb facs="tcp:5274:5"/>
by three attributes, the which doo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the operation of God towardes his creatures. Theſe are his wiſedome, will, and omnipotencie.</p>
            <p>The wiſedome or knowledge of God, is that by the which God dooth not ſucceſsiuelye, and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of reaſon, but by one eternall and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble act of vnderſtanding diſtinctlye, and perfectlye know himſelfe, and al other things, though infinite, whether they haue bene or not. <hi>Math.</hi> 11.27. <hi>No man knoweth the Sonne but the Father, nor the Father but the Sonne, and he to whome the Sonne, will reueale him.</hi> Heb. 4.13. <hi>There is nothing created which is not manifeſt in his ſight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, with whome we haue to doo.</hi> Pſal. 147.5. <hi>His wiſdome is infinite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods wiſedome hath theſe partes. His fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and his counſell.</p>
            <p>The foreknowledge of God, is that by which he moſt aſſuredly foreſeeth all thinges that are to come. Act. 2.23. <hi>Him haue ye taken by the handes of the wicked, being deliuered by the determinate counſell and foreknowledge of God, and haue crucified and ſlain,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>Thoſe which he knew before, he alſo predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be made like to the image of his Sonne.</hi> This is not properly ſpoken of God, but by reaſon of men to whom things are paſt, or to come.</p>
            <p>The counſell of God, is that by which he doth moſt ſtraightlye perceiue the beſt reaſon of all things that are <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.14. <hi>I haue counſell &amp; wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſhrength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The will of God, is that by the which he both
<pb facs="tcp:5274:6"/>
moſt freely, and ſtraitly with one act willeth all thinges. Rom. 9.18. <hi>He hath mercie on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> Eph. 1.5. <hi>Who hath predeſtinate vs to be adopted through Ieſus Christ vnto himſelfe, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> Iam. 4.15. <hi>For that which you ſhould ſay, if the Lord will, we will liue and doe this or that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God willeth that which is good, by approuing it, that which is euill, in as much as it is euill, by diſalowing and not willing it. And yet he volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily doth permit euill: Becauſe it is good that there ſhould be euill. Act. 14.16. <hi>Who in times paſt ſuffered all the Gentils to walke in their owne waies.</hi> Pſal. 81.12. <hi>So I gaue them vp to the hardnes of their heart, and they haue walked in their owne counſels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The will of God, by reaſon of diuers obiectes hath diuers Names, and is either called Loue and Hatred, or Grace and Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>The loue of God, is that, by the which God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth firſt, himſelfe, and then all his creatures without their deſert, &amp; in them doth take delight. 1. Ioh. 4.16. <hi>God is loue, and who ſo remaineth in loue, remaineth in God, and God in him.</hi> Ioh. 3.16. <hi>So God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the world, that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 5.8. <hi>God ſetteth out his loue toward vs, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The hatred of God, is that by the which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liketh, and deteſteth his creature offending, for his fault. 1. Cor. 10.5. <hi>But manie of them the Lord miſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, for they periſhed in the wildernes.</hi> Pſal. 5.5. <hi>Thou hatest all the workers of iniquitie.</hi> Pſal. 44.8. <hi>Thou haſt
<pb facs="tcp:5274:6"/>
loued iuſtice and hated iniquitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The grace of God, is that by which hee freely declareth his fauour to his creatures. Rom. 11.6. <hi>If it be of Grace, it is no more of workes: otherwiſe Grace is not grace, but if it be of workes, it is no more grace.</hi> Titus. 2.11. <hi>The ſauing grace of God ſhined to all men teaching vs to dente impietie, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The grace of God, is eyther his Goodneſſe, or his Mercie.</p>
            <p>The goodneſſe of God, is that by which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in himſelfe abſolutely good, doth freely exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his liberalitie vpon his creatures Matth. 19.17. <hi>Why calleſt thou me good, none is good but one, euen God.</hi> Matth. 5.45. <hi>He maketh his ſunne to ſhine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good and the bad, and he raineth vpon the iust and vniuſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods mercie, is that by which he freely aſſiſteth all his creatures in their miſeries. Eſay. 30.18. <hi>Yet will the Lord waite, that he may haue mercie vpon you.</hi> Leuit. 3.22. <hi>It is the Lordes mercies, that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſion faile not.</hi> Exod. 33.19. <hi>I take pitie on whom I take pitie, and am mercifull on whom I am mercifull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods Iuſtice, is that by which he in all thinges willeth that which is iuſt. Pſal. 10. <hi>The iuſt Lord lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth iuſtice.</hi> Pſal. 3.4. <hi>For thou art not a God that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth wickedneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods iuſtice, is in word, or deede.</p>
            <p>Iuſtice in word, is that truth by which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, &amp; indeede willeth that which he hath ſaid Rom. 3.4. <hi>Let God be true, &amp; euery man a lyar.</hi> Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>OVt of the former attributes by which the true Iehouah is diſtinguiſhed from a fained God, and from idoles, ariſe the glorye of God and his bleſſednes.</p>
            <p>Gods glorie or maieſtie, is the infinite excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his moſt ſimple and moſt holye diuine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Heb. 1.3. <hi>Who being the brightnes, of his glorye, and the ingraued forme of his perſon &amp;c.</hi> Dan. 3. <hi>Thou Lord art only God, and glorious vpon the earth,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this we ſee, that God onely can knowe him ſelfe perfectly. Iohn. 6.46. <hi>Not that any man hath ſeene the Father, ſaue he which is of God, he hath ſeene the Father.</hi> 1. Tim. 6.16. <hi>Who only hath immortalitie, and dwelleth in the light, that none can attaine vnto, whome neuer man ſawe, neither can ſee.</hi> Exod. 33.18. <hi>Thou canſt not ſee my face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding there is a certaine manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods glorie: partlye more obſcure, partlye more apparant.</p>
            <p>The more obſcure manifeſtation, is the viſion of Gods maieſtie in this life, by the eyes of the
<pb facs="tcp:5274:7"/>
minde, through the helpe of thinges perceiued by the outward ſences.</p>
            <p>Eſai. 6.1. <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting vpon an high throne, and lifted vp, and the lower partes thereof filled the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Exod. 33.22. <hi>And while my glorye paſſeth by, I will put thee in a cleft of the Rocke, and will couer thee with mine hands while J paſſe by: after J wil take away mine hand, and thou ſhalt ſee my backeparts, but my face ſhall not be ſeene.</hi> 1. Cor. 13.12. <hi>Now we ſee as through a glaſſe, darkely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The more apparant manifeſtation of God, is the contemplation of him in Heauen face to face. 1. Cor. 13.12. <hi>But then ſhall we ſee face to face.</hi> Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. 7.9.10. <hi>I behelde till the thrones were ſet vp, and the Ancient of dayes did ſit, whoſe garment was white as Snowe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods bleſſednes, is that by which God is in himſelfe, and of him ſelfe all ſufficient.

               <hi>Chap. 5.</hi> Concerning the perſons of the Godhead.</head>
            <p>THe perſons, are they, which ſubſiſting in one Godhead, are diſtinguiſhed by incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble properties. 1. Iohn. 5.7. <hi>There are three that beare recorde in heauen, the Father, the Worde, and the holye Ghoaſt, and theſe</hi> 3. <hi>are one.</hi> Gen. 19.24. <hi>Then Jehouah rained vpon Sodome, and vpon Gomorah, brimſtone, and
<pb facs="tcp:5274:8"/>
fire from Jehouah in heauen.</hi> Ioh. 1.1. <hi>Jn the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and that word was God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The conſtitution of a perſon is, when as a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall proprietie, or the proper manner of ſubſiſting is adioyned to the Deitie, or one diuine nature.</p>
            <p>Diſtinction of perſons, is that, which albeit eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon is one and the ſame perfect God, yet the Father is not the Sonne or the holye Ghoſt, but the Father alone; the Sonne is not the Father or the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, but the Sonne alone; and the holy Ghoaſt is not the Father or the Sonne, but the holy Ghoaſt alone: ſo that in theſe there is diuerſitie of perſons, but vnitie of eſſence.</p>
            <p>The communion of the perſons, or rather vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is that by which eche one is in the reſt, and with the reſt, by reaſon of the vnitie of the Godhead: and therefore euerye eche one doth poſſeſſe loue, and glorifie another, and work the ſame thing. Ioh. 14.10. <hi>Beleeueſt thou not that J am in the Father, and the Father is in me? the wordes that I ſpeak vnto you, J ſpeake not of my ſelfe but my Father that dwelleth in me, he doth the workes.</hi> Pro. 8.22. <hi>The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: J was before his workes of olde.</hi> And verſ. 30. <hi>Then was J with him as a nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher, and J was dayly his delight, reioycing alwaye before him.</hi> Ioh. 1.1. <hi>Jn the beginning was the word, &amp; the word was with God, and that word was God.</hi> &amp; Chap. 5.19. <hi>The Sonne can doo nothing of himſelfe, ſaue that he ſeeth the Father doo: for whatſoeuer things he doth, the ſame doth the Sonne alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:8"/>There be three perſons, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt. Math. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And loe, a voice came from heauen, ſaying. This is my beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Father, is a perſon without beginning, who from all eternitie begate the Sonne. Heb. 1.3. <hi>Who being the brightneſſe of the glorie, and the ingraued forme of his perſon.</hi> Pſalm. 2.7. <hi>Thou art my Sonne this daye haue I begotten thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The incommunicable propertie of the Father, is to be vnbegotten. He is the beginning of actions, becauſe he beginneth euery action of himſelfe, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting it by the Sonne &amp; the holy ghoſt. 1. Cor. 8.6. <hi>Yet vnto vs, there is but one God, which is the Father of whome are all things, and we in him, and one Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by whome are all thinges, and we by him.</hi> Rom. 11.36. <hi>For of him, and through him, and for him are all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other two perſons haue the Godhead, or the whole diuine eſſence, of the Father by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, namely the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>The Sonne is the ſecond perſon, begotten of the Father, from all eternitie. Heb. 1.5. <hi>For vnto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, thou art my Sonne this day begat I thee?</hi> Col. 1.15. <hi>Who is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not his owne Sonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this cauſe he is ſaide to be ſent from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Ioh. 8.42. <hi>I proceeded forth and came from God, neither came I of my ſelfe but he ſent me.</hi> This ſending taketh not away the equalitie of eſſence and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but declareth the order of the perſons. Ioh. 5.18. <hi>Therefore the Iewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the Sabaoth, but ſaid alſo that god was his Father, and made himſelf equall with God.</hi> Phil. 2.6. <hi>Who being in the forme of God, thought is no robbery to be equall with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this cauſe alſo he is <hi>the WORD of the father,</hi> not a vaniſhing but an eſſentiall woord, becauſe as a word, is as it were begotten of the minde, ſo is the Sonne begotten of the Father. And alſo, becauſe he bringeth glad tidinges from the boſome of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nazian in his oration of the Sonne, Baſil in his preface before Iohns goſpell.</p>
            <p>The propertie of the Sonne, is to be begotten.</p>
            <p>His proper manner of working, is to execute ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the father by the holy ghoſt, 1. Cor. 8.6. <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whome are all things and we by him.</hi> Ioh. 5.19. <hi>Whatſoeuer things he dooth, the ſame doth the ſonne alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The holy Ghoſt is the third perſon, proceeding from the Father and the Sonne. Ioh. 15.26. <hi>But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the comforter ſhall come, whom I wil ſend vnto you from the Father, euen the Spirite of trueth, which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the Father, he ſhall teſtifie of me.</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>But ye are not in the fleſh, but in the Spirite, ſeeing the Spirite of God dwelleth in you. But if there be any that hath not

            <p>THus far concerning the firſt part of Theologie: the ſecond followeth, of the works of God.</p>
            <p>The works of God, are all thoſe; which he doth out of himſelfe, that is, out of his diuine eſſence.</p>
            <p>Theſe are common to the Trinitie, alwaies reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the peculier ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of working in euery perſon.</p>
            <p>The end of all theſe is the manifeſtation of the glorie of God. Rom 11.36. <hi>For him are all thinges, to him be all glory for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The woorke of action of God, is either his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree or the execution of his decree.</p>
            <p>The decree of God, is that by which God in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, hath neceſſarily and yet freelye, from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie determined all things.

            </p>
            <p>The thing which in the one nature is euill, in Gods eternall counſell comes in the place of a good thing; in that it is ſome occaſion, &amp; way to manifeſt the glory of God in his iuſtice, and in his mercie.</p>
            <p>The execution of Gods decree, is that by which all thinges in their time are accompliſhed, which were foreknowen, or decreed, &amp; that euen as they were foreknowen and decreed.</p>
            <p>The ſame decree of God, is the firſt &amp; principall working cauſe of al things, which is in order &amp; time before all other cauſes. For with Gods decree is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

And with Gods will is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyned an effectuall power, by which the Lord can bring to paſſe whatſoeuer he hath frely decreed.</p>
            <p>This firſt and principall cauſe, how be it in it ſelfe it be neceſſary, yet it doth not take away freedome of will in election, or the nature and propertie of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, but only brings them into a certain or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that is, it directeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the determinate end: wherupon the effects and euents of things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent or neceſſarye, as the nature of the ſecond cauſe is. So Chriſt according to his Fathers decree died neceſſarily. <hi>Act. 17.3.</hi> But yet willinglye. <hi>Mat. 25.39.</hi> And if we reſpect the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature of Chriſts body, he might haue prolonged his life; &amp; therfore in this reſpect might be ſaid to haue died co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly.</p>
            <p>The execution of Gods decree hath two braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, his operation and his operatiue permiſsion.</p>
            <p>Gods operation, is his effectuall producing of al good things, which either haue being or mouing, or which are done.</p>
            <p>Gods operatiue permiſsion, is that by which he only permitteth one and the ſame work to be done of others, as it is euill; but as it is good, he effectually worketh the ſame. Gen. 50.20. <hi>You indeed had purpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed euill againſt me, but God decreed that for good, that he might as he hath doon this day, preſerue his people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue.</hi> and Gen. 45.7. <hi>God hath ſent me before you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue your poſteritie in this Land.</hi> Eſay. 10.5.6.7. <hi>Woe

                  </gap>y wrath, to take the ſpoyle, and to take the praye, and to tread them vnder feete like the mire in the ſtreet. But he thinketh not ſo, neither doth his hart eſteeme it ſo but he imagineth to deſtroy, and to cut off not a fewe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God permitteth euill, by a certain voluntary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, in that he forſaketh the ſecond cauſe in working euil. And he forſaketh his creature, either by detracting the grace he had, or not beſtowing that which he wanteth. Rom. 1.26. <hi>For this cauſe god gaue them vp vnto vile affections.</hi> 2. Tim. 2.25.26. <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them with meeknes that are contrary minded, prouing if God at any time wil giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repentance, that they may know the trueth, and that they may come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment out of the ſnare of the Deuill, which are taken of him at his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither muſt we think God vniuſt, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to none. Rom 9.15. <hi>I will haue mercy on him, to whome I will ſhewe mercie.</hi> Yea, it is in Gods plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to beſtowe how much grace, and vpon whom he will. Math. 20.15. <hi>Is it not lawfull for me to doo as I will with mine own?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which is euill hath ſome reſpect of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in that it is the puniſhment of ſinne, and puniſhment is accounted a morrall good; in that, it is the parte of a iuſt iudge to puniſh ſinne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as it is a meere action oract.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:11"/>Thirdlye, as it is a chaſtiſement, a triall of ones faith, martirdome, propitiation for ſinne, as the death and paſsion of Chriſt. Act. 2.23. &amp; 4.28. And if we obſerue theſe caueates, God is not onelye a bare permiſsiue agent in an euill worke, but a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull effect or of the ſame, yet ſo, as he neither inſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth an aberration into the action, nor yet ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, or intendeth the ſame, but that he moſt freely ſuffereth euill, and beſt diſpoſeth of it to his owne glory. The like we may ſee in this ſimilitude. Let a man ſpurre forward a lame horſe; In that he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth forward the rider is the cauſe, but that he hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, he himſelfe is the cauſe. And again, we ſee the Sunne beames gathering themſelues into a Sunne glaſſe, they burne ſuch thinges as they light vpon: now, that they burne, the cauſe is not in the Sunne, but in the glaſſe. The like may be ſaide of Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in an euill ſubiect.</p>

            <p>GOds decree, in as much as it concerneth man, is called predeſtination: which is the decree of God, by the which he hath ordeined all men, to a certain and euerlaſting eſtate; that is, either to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation or condemnation, for his own glory. 1. Theſ. 5.9. <hi>For God hath not appointed vs vnto wrath, but to obtaine ſaluation by the meanes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:12"/>
Rom. 9.13. <hi>As it is written, I haue loued Jacob &amp; hated Eſais.</hi> and ver. 12. <hi>What and if God would to ſhewe his wrath and make his power knowne, ſuffer with long pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the veſſels of wrath prepared to deſtruction, and that he might declare the riches of his glorye vpon the veſſels of mercy, which he hath prepared vnto glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meanes of accompliſhing Gods predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are two folde.</p>
            <p>The creation, and the fall.</p>
            <p>The creation, is that by which God made all things, very good, of nothing, that is of no matter, which was before the creation. Gen. 1.1. <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God created the heauen, &amp;c. to the end of the chap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods manner of creating as alſo of gouerning, is ſuch as that by his woord alone, he, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes, meanes, aſsiſtance, or motion produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all ſortes of thinges. For to will any thing with God, is both to be able, and to performe it. Heb. 11.3. <hi>By faith we vnderſtand, that the worlde was ordeined by the word of God, ſo that the thinges which we ſee, are not made of things which did appeere.</hi> Pſal. 148.5. <hi>Let them praiſe the name of the Lord, for he commaunded and they were created.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The goodnes of the creature, is a kinde of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, by which it was voide of all ſinne, that is, free from puniſhment and tranſgreſsion.</p>
            <p>The creation, is of the world, or inhabitantes in the world.</p>
            <p>The world, is a moſt beautifull pallace, framed out of a deformed ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and fit to be inhabited.</p>
            <p>The parts of the world, are the heauens, and earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:12"/>The heauens are threefolde, the firſt is the aire, the ſecond the Skye, the third an inuiſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporall eſſence, created to be the ſeate of all the bleſſed, both men and Angels. This third heauen is called Paradiſe. 2. Cor. 14.4.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of the worlde are reaſonable creatures, made according to Gods owne image, they are either angels or men. Gen. 1.26. <hi>Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more God ſaide, let vs make man in our owne image, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our likeneſſe.</hi> Iob. 1.16. <hi>When the children of God came and ſtoode before the Lorde: Satan came alſo among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The image of God is the integritie of the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, reſembling God in holineſſe. Eph. 4.24. <hi>And put on the new man which after God is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe.</hi>

               <hi>Fourthly, they are in the higheſt heauen, where they euer attend vpon God, and haue ſocietie with him.

            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly, their degree. That there are degrees of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, it is moſt plaine.

            <p>MAn, after he was created of God, was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in an excellent eſtate of innocencie. In this eſtate ſeuen thinges are chiefely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The place. The garden of Heden, that moſt pleaſant garden. Gen. 2.15. <hi>Then the Lord tooke the man, and put him into the garden of Heden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The integritie of mans nature. Which was Epheſ. 4.24. <hi>created in righteouſnes and true holines.</hi> This integritie hath two partes.</p>
            <p>The firſt is wiſedome, which is a true and
<pb facs="tcp:5274:14"/>
perfect knowledg of God, &amp; of his will, in as much as it is to be performed of man, yea, and of the counſaile of God in all his creatures. Col. 3.10. <hi>And haue put on the newe man, which is renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, after the image of him that created him.</hi> Gen. 2.19. <hi>When the Lord God had formed of the earth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie beast of the field, and euery foule of the heauen, he brought them vnto the man, to ſee how he would cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for howſoeuer the man called the liuing creature, ſo was the name thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſecond, is Iuſtice, which is a conformitie of the will, affections, and powers of the bodie to the will of God.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Mans dignitie, conſiſting of foure partes. Firſt, his communion with God, by which as God reioyced in his owne image, ſo likewiſe man was incenſed to loue God: This is apparant by Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar conference with Adam. Gen. 1 29. <hi>And God ſayd, Behold, I haue giuen vnto you euerie herbe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſeede, &amp;c. that ſhall be to you for meate.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his dominion ouer all the creatures of the earth. Gen. 2.19. Pſ. 8.6. <hi>Thou haſt made him Lord ouer the workes of thine handes, and haſt ſet all thinges vnder his feete, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, the decencie, and dignitie of the bodie, in which, though naked, nothing was vnſeemely.

               <pb facs="tcp:5274:14"/>
Fourthly, labour of the bodie without paine or griefe. Gen. 3.17.19. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt obeyed the voyce of thy wife, &amp;c. curſed is the earth for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eate of it all the daies of thy life, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IIII. Subiection to God, whereby man was bound to performe obedience to the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God: which were two. The one was concerning the two trees: the other, the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabboth.</p>
            <p>Gods commaundement concerning the trees, was ordeined to make examination, and triall of mans obedience. It conſiſteth of two partes: the firſt, is the eating of the tree of life, that as a ſigne, it might confirme to man, his perpetuall abode in the garden of Heden, if ſtill he perſiſted in obedience. Reuel. 2.7. <hi>To him that ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth will I giue to eate of the tree of life, which is in the middest of the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of God.</hi> Prou. 3.18. <hi>She is a tree of life to them which lay holde on her: and bleſſed is he that retaineth her.</hi> The ſecond, is the prohibition to eate of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill, together with a commination of temporal &amp; eternall death, after the tranſgreſsion of this commaundement. Gen. 2.17. <hi>Of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, thou ſhalt not eate of it, for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> This was a ſigne of death, and had his name of the euent, becauſe the obſeruation thereof would haue brought perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all happineſſe, as the violation gaue experience of euill, that is, of all miſerie, that is, of puniſhment and of guiltineſſe of ſinne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:15"/>Gods commaundement concerning the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Sabboth, is that, by which God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the ſanctification of the Sabboth. Gen. 2.3. <hi>God bleſſed the ſeuenth day, and ſanctified it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. His calling, which is his ſeruice of God, in the obſeruation of his commaundements, and the dreſsing of the garden of Heden. Prou. 16.4. <hi>God made all thinges for him ſelfe.</hi> Gen. 2.15. <hi>He placed him in the garden of Heden, to dreſſe and keepe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. His diet was the herbes of the earth, and fruit of euery tree, except the tree of the knowledg of good and euill. Gen. 1.29. <hi>And God ſayd, Behold, I haue giuen vnto you euery herbe bearing ſeede, which is vpon all the earth, and euery tree, wherein is the fruite of a tree bearing ſeede, that ſhall be to you for meate.</hi> and 3.17. <hi>But of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, thou ſhalt not eate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. His free choice, both to will, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the commaundement concerning the two trees, and alſo to neglect &amp; violate the ſame. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſee that our firſt parents were indeede crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perfect, but mutable: for ſo it pleaſed God to prepare a way to the execution of his decree.</p>

Laſtly, after God hath forſaken them, and left them to themſelues, they fall quite from God: no otherwiſe, then when a man ſtaying vp a ſtaffe from the ground, it ſtandeth vpright, but if he neuer ſo little withdrawe his hande, it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth of it ſelfe.</p>

damnation, &amp;c.</hi> Iude 6. <hi>The Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their owne habitation, he hath reſerued in euerlaſting chaines, &amp;c.</hi> Ioh. 8.44. <hi>He was a murtherer from the beginning, and continued not in the truth: for there is no truth in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fall of Angels, conſider: Firſt, their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, ariſing from their fall, which is the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of their nature. And is eyther that fearefull malice and hatred, by which they ſet them ſelues againſt God, or their inſatiable deſire to deſtroy mankinde, to the effecting whereof, they neglect neither force nor fraude. 1. Ioh. 3.8. <hi>He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſinne is of the deuill, becauſe the deuill ſinned from the beginning. For this cauſe was the Sonne of God reuealed, to diſſolue the workes of the deuill.</hi> 1. Pet. 5.8. <hi>Your aduerſarie the deuill goeth about like a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lyon, ſeeking whom he may deuour.</hi> Epheſ. 6.12. <hi>You ſtriue not againſt fleſh and bloud, but againſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, and power, and worldly gouernours, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of darkeneſſe of this world, againſt ſpirituall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which are in ſuperceleſtiall thinges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Their degree, and diuerſitie: for of theſe Angels, one is chiefe, and the reſt attendants. The chiefe, is Beelzebub, Prince of the reſt of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, and the world, farre aboue them all in malice. Matth. 25.41. <hi>Away from me ye curſed, into euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting fire, prepared for the deuill and his Angels.</hi> 2. Cor. 4.4. <hi>Whoſe mindes the god of this world hath blinded.</hi> Reuel. 12.7. <hi>And there was war in heauen, Michael, and his Angels fought with the Dragon, and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon and his angels fought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:16"/>Miniſtring angels, are ſuch as waite vpon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, in accompliſhing his wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Their puniſhment. God, after their fall, gaue them ouer to perpetuall tormentes, without any hope of pardon. Iude ver. 6.2. Pet. 2.4. <hi>God ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the Angels that had ſinned, but caſt them downe into hell, and deliuered them into chaines of darkeneſſe, to be kept vnto damnation.</hi> This he did, firſt, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh men, what great puniſhment they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Secondly, to ſhew, that grieuous ſinnes muſt more grieuouſly be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>The fall of Angels was the more grieuous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both their nature was more able to reſiſt, and the deuill was the firſt founder of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Their puniſhment is eaſier, or more grieuous.</p>
            <p>Their eaſier puniſhment is double. The firſt, is their deiection from heauen. 2. Pet. 2.4. <hi>God caſt the Angels that ſinned, into hell.</hi> The ſeconde, is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging and limitation of their power. Iob. 1.12. <hi>The Lord ſayd vnto Satan, Behold, all that he hath, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The more grieuous paine, is that torment in the deepe, which is endleſſe and infinite, in time and meaſure. Luke 8.31. <hi>And they beſought him, that he would not commaund them to go downe into the deepe.</hi>

               <hi>Chap. 11.</hi> Of mans fall, and diſobedience.</head>
            <p>ADams fall, was his willing reuolting to diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by eating the forbidden <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate. In A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams fall we may note the manner greatneſſe, and
<pb facs="tcp:5274:17"/>
fruit of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The manner of Adams fall was on this ſort. Firſt, the death, hauing immediatly before, fallen him ſelfe, inſinuateth vnto our firſt parents, that both the puniſhment for eating the forbidden fruit was vncertaine, and that God was not true in his word vnto them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by his legerdemaine he blinded the eyes of their vnderſtanding. Thirdly, being thus blinded, they begin to diſtruſt God, &amp; to doubt of Gods fauour. Fourthly, they thus doubting are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be hold the forbidden fruite. Fiftly, they no ſooner ſo the beautie therof, but they deſire it. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they may ſatisfie their deſire, they eate of the fruit, which by the hands of the woman was taken from the tree: by which act they become vtterly diſloyall to God. Gen. 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Thus without conſtraint, they willingly fall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their integritie, God vpon iuſt cauſes leauing them to themſelues, and freely ſuffered them to fall. For wee muſt not thinke that mans fall was either by chaunce, or God not knowing it, or barely winking at it, or by his bare permiſsion, or againſt his will: but rather miraculouſly, not without the will of God, but yet without all approbation of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The greatnes of this tranſgreſsion muſt be eſteemed, not by the externall obiect, or the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of an apple, but by the offence it contayneth againſt Gods maieſtie. This offence appeareth, by many treſpaſſes committed in that action. 1. The firſt, is doubting of Gods word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Want of fayth.
<pb facs="tcp:5274:17"/>
For they beleeue not Gods threatning. <hi>(In the day ye eate thereof, you ſhall die the death.)</hi> But being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with the deuils promiſe, <hi>(ye ſhalbe like gods)</hi> they ceaſe to feare Gods puniſhment, and are infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a deſire of greater dignitie. 3. Their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie, in forſaking Gods word, and ſeeking other wiſedome. 4. Their pride, in ſeeking to magnifie themſelues, and to become like God. 5. Contempt of God, in tranſgreſsing his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement againſt their owne conſcience. 6. In that they preferre the deuill before God. 7. Ingratitude, who, in as much as in them lyeth, expell Gods ſpirite dwelling in them, and deſpiſe that bleſſed vnion. 8. They mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both them ſelues and their progenie.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The fruite or effectes. Out of this corrupt eſtate of our firſt parents, aroſe the eſtate of vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, whereby God hath included all men vnder ſinne, that he might manifeſt his mercy in the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of ſome, and his iuſtice in condemnation of others. Rom. 11.32. <hi>God hath ſhut vp all men in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, that he might haue mercie on all.</hi> Gal. 3.22. <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all vnder ſinne, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be giuen to them that beleeue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this eſtate, we muſt conſider ſinne, and the puniſhment of ſinne. Sinne is threefolde.</p>
            <p>The firſt, is the participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Adams both <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion</hi> and <hi>guiltineſſe:</hi> whereby, in his ſinne, all his poſteritie ſinned. Rom. 5.12. <hi>As by one man ſinne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world, and by ſinne death, ſo death entred vpon all men, in that all man haue ſinned.</hi> The reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:5274:18"/>
of this is readie. Adam was not then a priuate man, but repreſented all mankinde, and therefore looke what good he receiued from God, or euill elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, both were common to others with him. 1. Cor. 15.22. <hi>As in Adam all men die, ſo in Christ all men riſe againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, when Adam offended, his poſteritie was in his loynes, from whom they ſhould, by the courſe of nature, iſſue: and therefore take part of the guiltineſſe with him Heb. 7.9.10. <hi>And to ſay as the thing is, Leu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>
               <hi>Chap. 12.</hi> Of originall ſinne.</head>
            <p>OVt of the former tranſgreſsion ariſeth another, namely, Original ſinne, which is corruption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in our firſt conception, whereby euery fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of ſoule and bodie is prone and diſpoſed to euill. Pſ. 51.5. <hi>I was borne in iniquitie, and in ſinne hath my mother conceiued me.</hi> Gen. 6.5. Tit. 3.3. <hi>We our ſelues were in times paſt vnriſe, diſobedient, deceiued, ſerued the lustes, and diuers pleaſures, liuing in mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe, and enuie, hatefull, and hating one another.</hi> Heb. 12.1. <hi>Let vs cast away euery thing that preſſeth downe, and the ſinne that hangeth ſo faſt on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this, we ſee that ſinne is not a corruption of mans ſubſtance, but onely of faculties: otherwiſe neither could mens ſoules be immortal, nor Chriſt take vpon him mans nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:18"/>The propagation of ſinne, from the parents to the children, is either becauſe the ſoule is infected by the contagion of the body, as a good ointment by a fuſtie veſſell: or becauſe God, in the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of creation &amp; infuſion of ſoules into infants, doth vtterly forſake them. For as Adam receiued the image of God both for himſelfe and others: ſo did he looſe it from himſelfe and others.</p>
            <p>That we may the better know originall ſinne in the ſeuerall faculties of mans nature, three circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances muſt be conſidered.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. How much of Gods image we yet retaine.</item>
               <item>2. How much ſinne man receiued from Adam.</item>
               <item>3. The increaſe thereof afterward.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. In the minde. The remnant of Gods image, is certaine motions concerning good &amp; euill: as, <hi>that there is a God, and that the ſame God puniſheth tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions: that there is an euerlaſting life: that we muſt reuerence our ſuperiors, and not harme our neighbour.</hi> But euen theſe motions, they are both ſeuerall and corrupt, and haue none other vſe, but to bereaue man of all excuſe before Gods iudgement ſeat. Rom. 1.19.20. <hi>That which may be knowen concerning God, is manifeſt in them: for God hath ſhewed it vnto them. For the inuiſible thinges of him, that is, his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power and Godhead, are ſeene by the creation of the world, being conſidered in his workes, to the intent they ſhould be without excuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mens minds receiued from Adam, 1. Ignorance, namely, a want, or rather a depriuation of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the things of God, whether they concerne
<pb facs="tcp:5274:19"/>
his ſincere worſhip, or eternall happines. 1. Cor. 2.14. <hi>The natural ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perceiueth not the things of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, for they are fooliſhnes vnto him, nether can he knew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Rom. 8.7. <hi>The wiſedome of the fleſh is enimitie with God, for it is not ſubiect to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Impotencie, whereby the mind of it ſelfe is vnable to vnderſtand ſpiritual things, though they be taught. Luk. 24.45. <hi>Then opened he their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that they might vnderſtand the ſcriptures.</hi> 2. Cor. 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our ſelues, to think any thing as of our ſelues: but our ſufficiencie is of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Vanitie, in that the mind thinketh falſhood truth, and truth falſhood. Eph. 4.7. <hi>Walke no more as other Gentils, in the vanitie of your vnderſtanding.</hi> 1. Cor. 1.21. <hi>It pleaſed God by the fooliſhnes of preaching, to ſaue thoſe which beleeue.</hi> 23. <hi>We preach Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, to the Iewes a ſtumbling blocke, but to the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans fooliſhnes.</hi> Prou. 14.12. <hi>There is a way which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good in the eies of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the end therof is death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. A naturall inclination only to conceiue, &amp; deuiſe the thing which is euill. Gen. 6.5. <hi>The Lorde ſaw that the wickedneſſe of man was great vpon earth, and al the imaginations of the thoughts of the hart were onely euill continually.</hi> Ier. 4.22. <hi>They are wiſe to doe euill, but to doe well they haue no knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is apparant, that the originall, and as I may ſay, the matter of all hereſies, is naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in mans nature. This is worthy the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of ſtudents in Diuinitie.</p>
            <p>The increaſe of ſinne in the vnderſtanding, is I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:19"/>
reprobate ſenſe, when God withdraweth the light of nature. Ioh. 12.40. <hi>He hath blinded their eyes, &amp; hardened their hearts, leaſt they ſhould ſee with their eies, and vnderſtand with their harts, and I ſhould heale them, and they be conuerted.</hi> Rom. 1.28. <hi>As they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not to know God, ſo God deliuered them vp vnto are probate minde, to do thoſe things which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</hi> II. The ſpirit of ſlumber. Rom. 11.8. <hi>God hath giuen them the spirit of ſlumber, &amp;c.</hi> III. A ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall drunkenneſſe. Eſay. 29.9. <hi>They we drunken, but not with wine, they ſtagger, but not by ſtrong drinke.</hi> IIII. Strong illuſions. 2. Theſſ. 2.11. <hi>God ſhall ſende them ſtrong illuſions, and they ſhall beleeue lies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The remnant of Gods image in the conſcience, is an obſeruing and watchfull power, like the eye of a keeper, reſerued in man, partly to reprooue, and partly to repreſſe the vnbrideled courſe of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Rom. 2.15. <hi>Which ſhew the effect of the Lawe written in their heartes, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſſe, and their thoughts accuſing one another or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which the conſcience hath receiued of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is the impureneſſe thereof. Tit. 1.15. <hi>To them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing nothing is pure, but euen their mindes and conſciences are defiled.</hi> This impuritie hath three effectes, the firſt is to excuſe ſinne: as, if a man ſerue God outwardly, hee will excuſe and cloake his inwarde impietie. Ma. 10.19.20. <hi>Thou knoweſt the commaundemente thou ſhalt not, &amp;c. Then be anſwered and ſayd, Maſter all theſe things haue I obſerued from my youth.</hi> Againe it
<pb facs="tcp:5274:20"/>
excuſeth intents not warranted in Gods worde. 1. Chro. 13.9. <hi>When they came to the threſhing floore of Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is to accuſe, and terrifie for dooing good. This we may ſee in ſuperſtitious idolaters, who are grieued whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they omit to performe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite, and idolatrous worſhip to their gods. Col. 2.21.22. <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not, which all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with vſing, and are after the commandements and doctrines of men.</hi> Eſay. 29.13. <hi>and their feare towarde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was taught them by the precept of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is to accuſe and terrifie for ſinne. Gen. 50.15. <hi>When Ioſephs brethren ſawe that their father was dead, they ſaide, it may be that Joſeph will hate vs, and well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay vs againe all the euill, which we did vnto him.</hi> Ioh. 8.9. <hi>And when they heard it, being accuſed by their owne conſciences they went out one by one.</hi> 1. Ioh. 3.20. <hi>Jf our heart condemne vs, God is greater then our heart.</hi> Though the conſcience ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe a man truely: yet that will not argue any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in it. Which appeareth, in that Adam in his innocencie had a God, yet no accuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>Impureneſſe increaſed in the conſcience, is firſt ſuch a ſenſeleſſe numneſſe, as that it can hardly accuſe a man of ſinne. Epheſ. 4.19. <hi>Who being past feeling haue giuen themſelues to wantonneſſe, to worke all vnleanneſſe, euen with greedines.</hi> 1.

            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Some greeuous horror, and terror of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Gen. 4.14. <hi>Beholde thou haſt caſt me this day from the earth, and from thy face ſhall I be hid?</hi> &amp; verſ. 13. <hi>My puniſhment is greater, then I can beare.</hi> The Symptomes of this diſeaſe, are blaſphemies, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of body, fearefull dreames.

            </p>
            <p>In the will, the remnant of Gods image, is a free choyce. Firſt, in euerye naturall action, belonging to eche liuing creature, as to nouriſh, to engender, to moue, to perceiue.

            <p n="2">II. An inward rebellion, wherby it vtterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth that which is good, deſiring and willing that alone which is euill.</p>
            <p>By this it appeareth, that the will is no agent, but a meere patient in the firſte acte of conuerſion to God, and that by it ſelfe it can neither begin that conuerſion, or any other inward and ſound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience due to Gods Law.</p>
            <p>That which the affections receiue, is a diſorder, by which they therefore are not well affected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they eſchewe that which is good, and purſue that which is euill. Galat. 5.24. <hi>They that are Chriſts, haue crucified the fleſh with their affections, and luſtes thereof.</hi> Rom. 1.26. <hi>therfore God gaue them ouer to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy luſtes.</hi> 1. King. 22.9. <hi>The King of Iſraell ſaide vnto Iehoſophat, yet is there one of whome thou maieſt take counſel, but him I hate, &amp;c.</hi> And 21.4. <hi>Therfore Achab came home to his houſe diſcontented, and angrie, for the word which Naboth ſpake vnto him, and he laid himſelfe on his bed, turning away his face leaſt he ſhould eat meat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which the body hath receiued, is, I. Fitnes to begin ſinne, This doth the body in tranſporting all obiects and occaſions of ſinne to the ſoule, Gen. 3.6. <hi>The woman ſeeing that the tree was good for meat, and pleaſant to the eyes, &amp;c. tooke of the fruit therof and did eate.</hi> II. A fitnes to execute ſinne, ſo ſoone as the heart hath begun it. Rom. 6. <hi>Neither giue your
<pb facs="tcp:5274:21"/>
members as weapons of iniuſtice to ſinne</hi> and ver. 19. <hi>As you haue giuen your members as ſeruantes to vncleannes and iniquitie, to commit iniquity, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Chap. 13.</hi> Of actuall ſinne.</head>
            <p>AFter originall ſinne in Adams poſteritie, actual tranſgreſsion taketh place. It is either inwarde or outward. Inward, is of the minde, will, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>The actuall ſinne of the minde, is the euil thought or intent therof, contrary to Gods law. Examples of euil thoughts, God (the onlye knower of the hart) hath in diuers places ſet down in his word. I. That there is no God. Pſalme. 10.4. <hi>The wicked is ſo proud that he ſeeketh not for God, he thinketh alwaies there is no God.</hi> Pſal. 14.1. <hi>The foole ſaith in his hart there is no God.</hi> II. That there is neither prouidence nor preſence of God in the worlde. Plal. 10.11. <hi>He hath ſaid in his hart God hath forgotten; he hideth his face &amp; will neuer ſee.</hi> ver. 13. <hi>Wherefore dooth the wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne God? he ſaith in his hart thou wilt not regarde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. It imagineth ſafegarde to it ſelfe from all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils. Pſal. 10.6. <hi>He ſaith in his hart, I ſhall neuer be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nor be in danger.</hi> Reuel. 18.7. <hi>She ſaith in her hart, I ſit being a Queene, and am no widow, and ſhall ſee no mourning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IIII. It eſteemeth it ſelfe more excellent then others. Apoc. 18.7. <hi>J ſit as a Queen,</hi> Luk. 18.11. <hi>The Phariſie ſtanding thus praied to himſelfe, I thanke thee
<pb facs="tcp:5274:22"/>
O God, that I am not as other men, extertioners, vniuſt, adulterers, nor yet as this publican.</hi> ver. 12. <hi>I faſt twiſe in the weeke, and giue tithe of all my poſſeſsions.</hi> ver. That the Goſpell of Gods kingdome is meere fooliſhnes. 1. Cor. 2.14. <hi>The naturall man perceiueth not the things of the Spirite of God, for they are fooliſhnes vnto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. To think vncharitably and maliciouſlye of ſuch as ſerue God ſincerelye. Mat. 12.24. <hi>When the Phariſes heard that, they ſaide he caſteth not out Deuils but by the Prince of Deuils.</hi> Pſal. 74.8. <hi>They ſaide in their hartes let vs deſtroye them altogither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. To thinke the day of death farre off. Eſay. 28.15. <hi>Ye haue ſaide, we haue made a couenant with death, and with hell, we are at agreement; though a ſcourge runne ouer and paſſe through, it ſhall not come at vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That the paines of hell may be eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the place before mentioned they ſay, <hi>with hell haue we made agreement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">IX. That God will deferre his both perticular and laſt generall comming to iudgement. Luke. 12.19. <hi>I will ſaye vnto my ſoule, ſoule thou haſt much goods laide vp for many yeeres:</hi> and ver. 45. <hi>If that ſeruant ſay in his hart, my maiſter will deferre his comming, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many carnal men pretend their good meaning: but when God openeth their eyes, they ſhall ſee theſe rebellious thoughts riſing in their mindes, as ſparcles out of a chimney.</p>
            <p>The actuall ſinne of both will; and affections is euery wicked motion, inclination, and deſire. Gal. 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:22"/>An actual outward ſinne, is that, to the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wherof, the members of the bodye doo, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the faculties of the ſoule, concurre. Such ſinnes as theſe are infinite. Pſal. 40.12. <hi>Innumerable troubles haue compaſſed me, my ſinnes haue taken ſuch holde vpon me, that I am not able to look vp, yea they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oe in number then the haires of mine head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Actuall ſinne, is of omiſsion or commiſsion; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, both theſe are in wordes or deeds.</p>
            <p>In the ſinne of commiſsion obſerue theſe two pointes. The degrees in committing a ſin, and the differences of ſinnes committed.</p>
            <p>The degrees are in number 4. Iam 1.14.15. <hi>Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is tempted, when he is drawne away by his owne concupiſcence, and is entiſed: Then when luſt hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, it bringeth foorth ſinne; and ſinne when it is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, bringeth foorth death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſte degree is temptation, whereby man is allured to ſinne, this dooth Sathan by offering to the minde that which is euill. Iohn. 13.2. <hi>The Dead had now put into the hart of Iudas Iſcariot Simons Sonne, to betray him.</hi> Act. 5.3. <hi>Peter ſaide to Ananias, why hath Sathan filled thine hart that thou ſhouldſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> 1. Chro. 21.1. <hi>And Sathan ſtood in againſt Iſraell, and prouoked Dauid to number Iſraell.</hi> This alſo is effected vpon occaſion of ſome externall obiect, which the ſences perceiue. Iob. 31.1. <hi>I haue made a couenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with mine eyes, why then ſhould I look vpon a maide?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tentation hath two partes, abſtraction, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcation.</p>
            <p>Abſtraction, is the firſte cogitation of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:5274:23"/>
ſinne, whereby the minde is with-drawne from Gods ſeruice, to the which it ſhoulde be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies readye preſt. Luke. 10.27. <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy hart, and all thy ſoule, with all thy thought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ineſcation, is that wherby an euill thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and for a time retained in the minde, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting the will, and affections, doth as it were, lay a baite for them to draw them to conſent.</p>
            <p>The ſecond degree, is conception, which is nothing elſe, but a conſent and reſolution to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſinne. Pſalm. 7.14. <hi>He ſhall trauaile with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, hee hath conceiued miſcheefe, but he ſhall bring foorth a lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third degree, is the birth of ſinne, namelye the committing of ſinne, by the aſsiſtance both of the faculties of the ſoule, and the power of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye.</p>
            <p>The fourth degree, is perfection, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin being by cuſtome perfect, and as it were ripe, the ſinner reapeth death, that is damnation.</p>
            <p>This appeareth in the example of Pharaoh, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cuſtome in any ſin is fearfull.</p>
            <p>Sinne actually committed hath fiue differences.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to conſent with an offender, and not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to commit ſinne. Ephe. 5.11. <hi>Haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull works of darkenes but reproue them rather.</hi> This is done three manner of waies.</p>
            <p n="1">I. When as a man in iudgement ſomewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the ſinne of another. Nomb. 29.6.10. <hi>Moſes and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the
<pb facs="tcp:5274:23"/>
rocke, and Moſes ſaide vnto them, heare now ye rebelles: ſhall we bring you water out of the rocke? 12. The Lord ſpake to Moſes and Aaron, becauſe ye beleeued me not, to ſanctifie me in the preſence of the children of Iſraell, into the land which I haue giuen them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. When the hart approueth in affection and conſent. Hitherto maye we referre both the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and maieſtrates concealing, and winking at of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. 1. Sam. 2.23. <hi>Ely ſaide, why do ye ſuch thinges? For of all this people J heare euill of you. Doo no more my Sonnes, &amp;c. Now that Elyes will agreeth with his ſonnes ſinnes it is manifeſt.</hi> ver. 26. <hi>Thou honoureſt thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren aboue me.</hi> III. Indeed, by counſaile, preſence, entiſement. Rom. 1.13. <hi>They not onelye do the ſame, but alſo fauour them that do them.</hi> Mark. 6.25.26. <hi>She ſaide vnto her mother, what ſhall I aske, and ſhe ſayde John Baptiſts head. &amp;c.</hi> Act. 22.20. <hi>When the blood of thy Martyr Stephen was ſhedde, J alſo ſtoode by, and conſented vnto his death, and kept the clothes of them that ſlue him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond eſſence, is to ſinne ignorantlye, as when a man dooth not expreſſelye and diſtinctlye know, whether that which he dooth, be a ſinne or not, or if he knew it, did not marke it. 1. Tim. 1.23. <hi>I before was a blaſphemer, a perſecutor, and an oppreſſor; but I was receiued to mercye, for I did it ignorauntlye through vnbeliefe.</hi> Nom. 35.22.23.24. <hi>If he puſhed him vnaduiſedly &amp; not of hatred, or caſt vpon him any thing without laying of waite, or any Stone, (wherby he might be ſlaine) and ſaw him not, or cauſed it to fall vpon him, and he dye, and was not his enemy, neither ſought him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:5274:24"/>
harme. Then the congregation ſhall iudge between the ſlayer and the auenger of blood according to theſe lawes.</hi> 1. Cor. 4.4. <hi>I know nothing by my ſelfe, yet am I not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by iuſtified.</hi> Pſal. 19.13. <hi>Cleanſe me from my ſecret ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third difference, is to ſinne vpon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but of infirmity, as when a man fearing ſome immine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t danger, or amazed at the horror of death, doth againſt his knowledge deny that truth, which otherwiſe he would acknowledge and embrace. Such was Peters fall, ariſing from the ouermuch raſhnes of the minde mingled with ſome feare.</p>
            <p>Thus all men offend, when the fleſh, and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate deſires ſo ouer rule the will, and euery good endeuour, that they prouoke man to that, which he from his hart deteſteth. Rom. 7, 19. <hi>I do not the thing which I would, but the euill which I would not, that doo I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth difference, is preſumptuous ſinning vpon knowledge. Pſal. 19.13. <hi>Keepe thy ſeruant from preſumptuous ſinnes: let them not reigne ouer me.</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto belongeth. I. Euery ſinne committed with an high hand, that is in ſome contempt of GOD. Nom. 15.30. <hi>The perſon that doth preſumptuouſly, &amp;c. ſhall be cut off from amongſt his people: becauſe he hath deſpiſed the woord of the Lord, and hath broken his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.</hi> II. Preſumption of Gods mercye in going euill. Eccleſ. 8.11. <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an euill worke is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the hart of the children of men is fully ſet in them to doe e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill.</hi> Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.4. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fulness &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:5274:24"/>
not knowing that the bountifulnes of God leadeth thee to repentance. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth difference, is to ſinne vpon knowledge and ſet mallice againſt God, and to this is the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt referred.</p>

            <p>PRedeſtination hath two partes; Election, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. 1. Theſ. 5.9. <hi>God hath not appointed vs to wrath, but to obtaine ſaluation by the meanes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Election, is Gods decree, whereby on his owne free will, he hath ordeined certaine men to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the praiſe of the glorie of his grace. Epheſ. 1.4.5.6. <hi>He hath choſen vs in him, before the foundation of the world, according to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of the glorie of his grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This decree, is that booke of life, wherein are written the names of the Elect. Reuel. 20.12. <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther booke was opened, which is the booke of life, and the dead were iudged of thoſe thinges, that were written in the bookes, according to their workes.</hi> 2. Tim. 2.19. <hi>The foundation of God remaineth ſure, and hath this ſeale, the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The execution of this decree, is an action, by which God, euen as he purpoſed with himſelf, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all thoſe things, which he decreede for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the elect. For they whome God elected to this end, that they ſhould inherite eternall life, were alſo elected to thoſe ſubordinat means, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as by ſteppes, they might attaine this ende, and without which it were impoſsible to obtaine it. Rom. 8.29.30. <hi>Thoſe which he knew before, he alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate

            </p>
            <p>There appertaine three things to the execution of this decree. Firſt, the foundation. Secondlye, the meanes. Thirdly, the degrees.</p>
            <p>The foundation is Chriſt Ieſus, called of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all eternitie, to performe the office of the Mediatour, that in him, all thoſe which ſhould be ſaued, might be choſen.

            <p>To the working of his Incarnation, concurre: Firſte, both his Natures. Secondlye, their Vnion. Thirdly, their diſtinction.</p>
            <p>Chriſts firſt Nature, is the Godhead, in as much as it belongeth to the Sonne, whereby he is God, Phil. 2.6. <hi>Who being in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to be equall with God.</hi> Ioh. 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and that word was God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was requiſite for the Mediatour to be GOD. I. That he might the better ſuſtaine that great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:26"/>
wherwith mankinde was ouerwhelmed; the greatnes wherof, theſe foure things declare. I. The greeuouſnes of ſinne, wherwith Gods Maieſty was infinitely offended, Gods infinite anger againſt this ſinne, the fearfull power of death, and the Deuils tyrannie, who is Prince of this world. II. That he might make his humaine nature both of plentifull merite, and alſo of ſufficient efficacie, for the worke of mans redemption. III. That he might in ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the elect eternall life and holines. Eſay. 43.12. <hi>I am the Lord, and there is none beſides me a Sauiour, I haue declared, and I haue ſaued, and I haue ſhewed, when there was no ſtrange God among you: therfore ye are my witneſſes, ſaith the Lord, that I am God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, the Godhead, in as much as it is the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Son, is Chriſts diuine nature: not as it is the Godhead of the Father, or the holye Ghoſt, for it is the office of the Sonne, to haue the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euery outward action of the Trinitie, from the Father to the holy Ghoſt. 1. Cor. 6.8. And he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by nature the Sonne of the Father, beſtoweth this priuiledge on thoſe that beleeue, that they are the Sonnes of God by adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ioh. 1.12. <hi>As many as receiued him, to them he gaue to be the Sonnes of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtes other nature, is his humanitie, whereby he, the Mediatour, is very man. 1. Tim. 2.5. <hi>One God, and one Mediator between God &amp; man, the man Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould be man. Firſt that God might be pacified in that nature, wherein he was offended.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:27"/>II. That he might vndergoe puniſhment due to ſin, the which the Godhead could not, being voyde and free from all paſsion.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Chriſt as he is man, is like vnto vs in al things, ſinne onely excepted. Heb. 2.17. <hi>In all things it became him to be made like vnto his brethren.</hi> 1. Cor. 13.4.</p>
            <p>Chriſt therfore is a perfect man, conſiſting of an eſſentiall and true ſoule and bodye, wherevnto are ioyned ſuch faculties and properties, as are eſſential vnto both. In his ſoule, is vnderſtanding, memorie, will, and ſuch like: in his body, length, breadth, and thicknes: yea, it is comprehended in one place, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſubiect to feeling, neither is there anye thing wanting in him, which maye either adorne, or make for the being of mans nature.</p>
            <p>Againe, Chriſt in his humanitie, was ſubiect to the infirmities of mans nature, which are theſe. I. To be tempted. Mat. 9.1. <hi>Ieſus was caried by the ſpirit into the deſert, to be tempted of the deuill.</hi> II. To feare. Heb. 5.7. <hi>Who in the dayes of his fleſh did offer vp prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications with ſtrong crying and teares, vnto him that was able to ſaue him from death, and was alſo heard in that which he feared.</hi> III. To be angrie. Mar. 3.5. <hi>Then he looked round about on them angerly, mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alſo for the hardnes of their hartes, and ſaide to the man, Stretch foorth thine hand.</hi> IV. Forgetfulnes of his office impoſed vpon him, by reaſon of the agony aſtoniſhing his ſences. Matth. 26.39. <hi>He went a little further, and fell on his face, and praied, ſaying: O Father if it be poſsible, let this cup paſſe from me: Neuertheles,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:27"/>
not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Theſe infirmities are not eſſentiall qualities, but accidentall to mans nature, and therfore may be left of Chriſt.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>Chap. 16.</hi> Of the vnion of two natures in Chriſt.</head>
            <p>NOw followeth the vnion of the two Natures in Chriſt, which eſpecially concerneth his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, for by it his humanitie did ſuffer death v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the croſſe in ſuch ſort, as he could neither be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, nor perpetuallye ouerwhelmed by it. Three things belong to the vniting of Natures.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Conception, by which his humane nature was by the wonderfull power and opperation of God, both immediatly, that is without mans help, and miraculouſly framed of the virgin Mary. Luke. 1.35. <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſhall come vpon thee, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the moſt High, ſhall ouerſhadowe thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Sanctification, whereby the ſame humane nature was purified, that is, altogither ſeuered by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, from the leaſt ſtaine of ſinne, to the ende that it might be holye, and be made fit to dye for others. Luk. 1.35. <hi>That holy thing which ſhalbe borne of thee, ſhall be called the Sonne of God.</hi> 1. Pet. 3.18. <hi>Chriſt hath once ſuffered for ſinnes, the iuſt, for the vniuſt.</hi> 1. Pet. 2.22. <hi>Who did not ſinne, neither was there guile found in his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Aſſumption, wherby the Woord, namelye, the ſecond perſon in trinitie tooke vpon him fleſh,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:28"/>
and the ſeed of Abraham, namely, that his humaine nature, to the ende, that it being deſtitute of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and perſonall ſubſtance, might in the perſon of the Word obtaine it: ſubſiſting, and as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupported of it for euer. Ioh. 1.14. <hi>That Word was made fleſh.</hi> Heb. 2.16. <hi>He took not vpon him the nature of Angels, but the ſeede of Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this wee maye ſee, that Chriſt is one onelye Sonne of God, not two: yet in two reſpectes is hee one. As he is the eternall Word, he is by nature the Sonne of the Father. As he is man, the ſame Sonne alſo, yet not by nature or by adoption, but onlye by perſonall vnion. Luke. 1.35. Mat. 3.17. <hi>This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Sonne, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The phraſe in Scripture agreeing to this Vnion, is the <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of proprieties,</hi> concerning which, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue two rules.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Of thoſe things, which are ſpoken or attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, ſome are onlye vnderſtoode of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature. As that Ioh. 8.58. <hi>Before Abraham was, I am.</hi> And that Coloſ. 1.15. <hi>Who is the image of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible God, the firſte borne of euerye creature.</hi> Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine agree only to his humanitie, as, <hi>borne, ſuffered, dead, buried, &amp;c.</hi> Luke. 2.52. <hi>And Ieſus encreaſed in wiſdome and ſtature, and in fauour with God and men.</hi> Laſtly, other things are vnderſtoode, onlye of both natures vnited together. As Matth. 17.5. <hi>This is my beloued Sonne, in whom only I am wel pleaſed, heare him.</hi> Ephe. 1.22. <hi>He hath made ſubiect all thinges vnder his feet, and hath appointed him ouer all thinges to be the head to the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:28"/>II. Some thinges are ſpoken of Chriſt, as he is God, which muſt be interpreted according to his humane natures. Act. 20.28. <hi>To feede the Church of God.</hi> I. Chriſt, <hi>which he</hi> (namely, according to his manhood) <hi>hath purchaſed with his owne bloud,</hi> 1. Cor. 2.8. <hi>If they had knowen this they would neuer haue crucified the Lord of glorie.</hi> Contrarily, ſome things are mentioned of Chriſt, as he is man, which onely are vnderſtoode of his diuine Nature. <hi>No man aſcended vp to heauen, but he that hath deſcended from heauen, the Sonne of man which is in heauen.</hi> This is ſpoken of his manhood, whereas we muſt vnderſtand, that only his Deitie came downe from heauen. Ioh. 6.62. <hi>What if ye ſhould ſee the Sonne of man,</hi> (vz. Chriſts humane nature) <hi>aſcend vp, where he</hi> (vz. his deitie) <hi>was before?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, by reaſon of this Vnion, Chriſt, as hee is man, is exalted aboue euery name: yea, he is ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; hath ſuch a great (though not infinite) mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of giftes, as farre ſurpaſſe all Saintes and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Eph. 1.21. <hi>And ſet him at his right hande in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly places, farre aboue all principality and power, and might, and dominion, and euery name that is named, not in this world only, but in that alſo that is to come.</hi> Heb. 1.6. <hi>When he bringeth his first begotten Sonne into the world, he ſaith, And let all the Angels of God worſhippe him.</hi> Colloſſ. 2.3. <hi>Jn whom all the treaſures of wiſedom and knowledge are hidden.</hi> Philip. 2.9, 10. <hi>Therefore God exalted him on hie, and gaue him a name aboue all names, that at the name of Ieſus, euery knee ſhould bow</hi> (namely, worſhip, and be ſubiect to him) <hi>both
<pb facs="tcp:5274:29"/>
of thinges in heauen, and things in earth, and thinges vnder the earth.</hi>

            <p>THe diſtinction of both natures, is that, wherby they, with their properties &amp; effectes, remaine, without compoſition, mingling or conuerſion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. Ioh. 10.17, 18. <hi>Therefore doth my Father loue me, becauſe I lay downe my life, that J might take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. No man taketh it from me, but J lay it downe of my ſelfe: I haue power to lay it downe, and haue power to take it againe.</hi> Ioh. 13.31, 32. <hi>Now is the Sonne of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in him, God ſhal alſo glorifie him in himſelfe.</hi> Here we may obſerue, that there is one will in Chriſt, as God: another, as man.

            <p>THus much concerning Chriſts incarnation. His Office followeth, to the perfect accompliſhing whereof, he was annointed of his Father, that is, he
<pb facs="tcp:5274:29"/>
was ſufficiently furniſhed both with giftes and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Hebr. 1.9. <hi>Therefore God, euen thy God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed thee with the oyle of gladneſſe aboue thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</hi> Eſay. 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord was vpon me, therefore he annointed me.</hi> Ioh. 3.33. <hi>God giueth him not the ſpirite by meaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This office is ſo appropriate to Chriſt, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole, or in part can it be tranſlated to any other. Heb. 7.24. <hi>This man becauſe he endureth for euer, hath an euerlaſting Prieſthood, or a Prieſthoode, that can not paſſe from one to an other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſt, as he is God, hath vnder him, Emperours, Kinges, Princes, to bee his Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: who therefore are called Gods. Pſal. 82.1. But as he is Mediatour, that is, a Prieſt, a Prophet, and King of the Church, he hath no Vicegerent, Vicar, or Lieutenant, who, in his eyther Kingly, or Prieſtly office, in both, or but one, can be in his ſteede.</p>
            <p>Chriſts office, is threefold: Prieſtly, Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Regall. Pſal. 110.1, 2, 3, 4. Eſay. 42.1.</p>
            <p>Chriſtes Prieſthood, is an office of his, whereby he performed all thoſe things to God, whereby is obtayned eternall life. Heb. 5.9. <hi>And being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrate, was made the author of eternall ſaluation vnto all them that obey him: &amp; is called of God an hie Prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedec.</hi> chap. 7.24, 25. <hi>This man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he endureth for euer, hath an euerlaſting Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, wherefore he is able alſo perfectly to ſaue all them that come vnto God by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Prieſthood conſiſteth of two partes: Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:30"/>
and interceſsion.</p>
            <p>Satisfaction, is that, whereby Chriſt is a full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation to his Father, for the elect. Iob. 33.23. <hi>If there be a meſſenger with him, or an interpreter, one of a thouſand to declare vnto man his righteouſnes, then will he haue mercie vpon him, and will ſay, deliuer him, that he goe not downe into the pit, for I haue founde a Reconciliation.</hi> Rom. 3.24. <hi>And are iuſtified freely by his grace, through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> 25. <hi>whom God hath ſet foorth to be a reconciliation through faith in his bloud.</hi> 1.

            </p>
            <p>Chriſt ſatisfied Gods anger for mans offence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humanitie, by perfourming perfect obedience to the wil of God: according to his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by miniſtring ſuch eſpeciall dignitie to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, as was both of full merite and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie before God, for the ſaluation of the Elect. Ioh. 17.19. <hi>For their ſakes ſanctifie I my ſelfe, that they alſo may be ſanctified through the truth.</hi> Act. 20.28. <hi>To ſeede the flocke of God, which he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his own bloud.</hi> 2.

            </p>
            <p>Satisfaction comprehendeth his Paſsion, and fulfilling the Law.</p>
            <p>His paſsion, is the firſt part of ſatisfaction, by which he, he hauing vndergone the puniſhment of ſinne, ſatisfied Gods iuſtice, and appeaſed his anger for the ſinnes of the faithfull. His paſsion was on this manner.</p>

               <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Somewhat before his death, partly feare ariſing from a ſenſe of Gods wrath imminent vpon him, partly griefe poſſeſsing, as it were, ech part of him, ſo diſturbed his ſacred minde, <hi rend="sup">b</hi> that inwardly for a while it ſtroke into him a ſtraunge kinde of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or rather obliuion of his duetie impoſed vpon him: and outwardly <hi rend="sup">c</hi> made him pray vnto his Father, (if he would) to remooue that cup from him, the which he did expreſſe with no ſmall crie, many teares, and a bloudie ſweate, <hi rend="sup">d</hi> trickling from his bodie vnto the ground.

            <p>In this diſcription of Chriſtes paſsion, wee may note fiue circumſtances eſpecially.</p>
            <p n="1">I. His Agony, namely, a vehement anguiſh ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vpon the conflict of two contrarie deſires in him. The firſt, was to be obedient to his Father. The ſecond, to auoyd the horror of death. Luk. 22.44. <hi>Being in an agonie he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweate was like drops of bloud, trickling downe to the ground.</hi> Heb. 5.7. <hi>In the daies of his fleſh did offer vp prayers and ſupplications with ſtrong crying and teares vnto him, that was able to ſaue him from death, and was alſo heard in that which he feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. His ſacrifice, which is an action of Chriſtes offering himſelfe to God the Father, as a ranſome
<pb facs="tcp:5274:31"/>
for the ſinnes of the elect. Heb. 9.26. <hi>Now in the end of the world hath he appeared once to put away ſinne, by the ſacrifice of himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this ſacrifice, the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was Chriſt, as he was man, Heb. 10.10. <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the offering of the body of Ieſus Chriſt once made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Altar alſo was Chriſt, as he was God. Heb. 13.10. <hi>We haue an altar, wherof they haue no authority to eate which ſerue in the tabernacle.</hi> Heb. 9.14 <hi>How much more ſhall the bloud of Christ, which through the eternal ſpirit offered himſelfe without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead workes, to ſerue the liuing God?</hi> Hence is it that Chriſt is ſayd to ſanctifie him ſelfe, as he is man. Ioh. 17.19. <hi>For their ſakes ſanctifie I my ſelfe.</hi> Matth. 23.17. <hi>As the altar, the gift, and the temple, the gold.</hi> Matt. 23.17.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is the Prieſt, as he is God and man. Heb. 5.6. <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for euer after the order of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec.</hi> 1. Tim. 5.6. <hi>One Mediator betweene God &amp; man, the man Christ Ieſus, who gaue himſelfe a ranſome for all men, to be a teſtimonie in due time.</hi>
            </p>

what it is but that he had alſo deſcended firſt into the loweſt part of the earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was neceſſarie that Chriſt ſhould be captiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of death, that he might aboliſh the ſting, that is, the power thereof. 1. Cor. 15.55. <hi>O death where is thy ſting? O hell where is thy uictorie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we haue heard of Chriſts meruelous paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the which (as we may further obſerue) is a perfect ranſome for the ſinnes of all and euery one of the elect. 1. Tim. 2.6. <hi>Who gaue himſelfe a ranſome for all men.</hi> For it was more, that Chriſt the onely begotten ſonne of God, yea, God himſelfe for a ſmal while ſhould beare the curſe of the Law, then if the whole worlde ſhould haue ſuffered eternall puniſhment.</p>
            <p>This alſo is worthy our meditation, that then a man is well grounded in the doctrine of Chriſtes paſsion, when his heart ceaſeth to ſinne, and is pricked with the griefe of thoſe ſinnes, whereby as with ſpeares he pearced the ſides of the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate lambe of God. 1. Ioh. 3.6. <hi>Who ſo ſinneth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſeene him, nor knowen him.</hi> Zach. 12.10. <hi>And they ſhall looke vpon me, whom they haue pearced, and they ſhall lament for him, as one lamenteth for his onely ſonne, and be ſorrie for him, as one is ſorrie for his firſt borne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Chriſtes paſsion followeth the fulfilling of the Lawe, by which he ſatisfied Gods iuſtice in fulfilling the whole Law. Rom. 8.3.4. <hi>God ſent his owne ſonne, that the righteouſneſſe of the law might be fulfilled by vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:33"/>He fulfilled the lawe, partly by the holineſſe of his humane nature, and partly by obedience in the workes of the law. Rom. 8.2. <hi>The lawe of the ſpirite of life, which is in Christ Ieſus, hath freed me from the law of ſinne and of death.</hi> Matth. 3.15. <hi>It becommeth vs to fulfill all righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſucceedeth the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part of Chriſts prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, namely interceſsion, whereby Chriſt is an Aduocate, and intreater of God the father for the faithfull. Rom. 8.34. <hi>Christ at the right hand of God, and maketh requeſt for vs.</hi> Chriſts interceſsion is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to God the father. 1. Ioh. 2.1. <hi>If any man ſinne we haue an aduocate with the father, euen Ieſus Chriſt, the iuſt.</hi> Now as the father is firſt of the Trinitie in order, ſo if he be appeaſed, the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt are appeaſed alſo. For there is one and the ſame agreement and will of all the perſons of the Trinitie.</p>
            <p>Chriſt maketh interceſsion according to both natures. Firſt according to his humanitie, partly by appearing before his father in heauen, partly by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the ſaluation of the elect. Heb. 9.24. <hi>Christ is entred into very heauen to appeare now in the ſight of God for vs. &amp;</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able perfectly to ſaue them that come to God by him, ſeeing he euer liueth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> Secondly, according to his dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, partly by applying the merite of his death, partly by making requeſt by his holy ſpirite, in the heartes of the elect, with ſighes vnſpeakeable. 1. Peter 1.2. <hi>Elect according to the foreknowledge of the father to the ſanctification of the ſpirit.</hi> Rom. 8.26.
<pb facs="tcp:5274:34"/>
               <hi>The ſpirit helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what to pray as we ought, but the ſpirite it ſelfe maketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for vs with ſighes which cannot be expreſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not therefore to imagine or ſurmiſe, that Chriſt proſtrateth himſelfe vpon his knees before his fathers throne for vs, neither is it neceſſary, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his very preſence before his father, hath in it, the force of an humble petition.</p>
            <p>The end of Chriſtes interceſsion is, that ſuch as are iuſtified by his merites, ſhould by this meanes continue in the ſtate of grace. Now Chriſtes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion preſerueth the elect in couering their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſlips, infirmities, and imperfect actions, by an eſpeciall and continuall application of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. That by this meanes mans perſon may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine iuſt, and mans workes acceptable to God. 1. Ioh. 2.2. <hi>He is a reconciliation for our ſinnes, and not for ours only but for the ſinnes of the whole worlde.</hi> 1. Pet. 2.5. <hi>Ye as liuely ſtones, be made a spirituall houſe and holy prieſthood, to offer vp ſpirituall ſacrifices accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Reuel. 8.3.4. <hi>An other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell came and ſtoode before the alter hauing a golden cenſer, and much odours was giuen vnto him that hee ſhould offer with the praiers of all ſaints vpon the golden alter, which is before the throne, and the ſmoke of the odours with the praiers of the ſaintes, went vp before God out of the Angels hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus farre concerning Chriſts Prieſthood, now follow his Propheticall and Regall offices.</p>
            <p>His Propheticall office is that, wherby he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from his father reuealeth his worde and all
<pb facs="tcp:5274:34"/>
the meanes of ſaluation compriſed in the ſame. Ioh. 1.18. <hi>The Sonne, which is in the boſome of his father, he hath declared vnto you.</hi> Ioh. 8.26. <hi>Thoſe thinges which I heare of my father J ſpeake to the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word was firſt reuealed, partly by viſions by dreames, by ſpeech: partly by the inſtinct &amp; motion of the holy Ghoſt. Heb. 1.1.2. <hi>At ſundrie times, &amp; in diuers manners God ſpake in olde time to our fathers the Prophets: in theſe last daies he hath ſpoken to vs by his ſonne.</hi> 2. Pet. 1.21. <hi>Prophecie came not in old time, by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were mooued by the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like is done ordinarily by the preaching of the word, where the holy Ghoſt doth inwardly il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate the vnderſtanding. Luke 24.45. <hi>Then ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he their vnderſtanding, that they might vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſcriptures.</hi> 21.15. <hi>I will giue you a mouth &amp; wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where against all your aduerſaries ſhall not be able to ſpeake nor reſist.</hi> Act. 16.14. <hi>Whoſe heart the Lord opened, that ſhe attended to the things that Paul ſpake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this cauſe Chriſt is called the Doctor, Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and Counſeller of his Church Mat. 23.10. <hi>Be ye not called Doctors, for one is your Doctor, Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Iam. 4.12. <hi>There is one lawgiuer which is able to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſoueraigne authoritie of expounding the Scripture, only belongs to Chriſt: and the Church hath onely the miniſterie of iudgement and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb facs="tcp:5274:35"/>
committed vnto her.</p>
            <p>Chriſts Regall office, is that whereby he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth his gifts, and diſpoſeth all things for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of the elect. Pſal. 2. &amp; 110.31.2. <hi>The Lorde ſaide vnto my Lorde, ſit thou on my right hande, till I make thine enemies thy footeſtoole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The execution of Chriſts Regall office compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth his exaltation.</p>
            <p>Chriſts exaltation is that, by which he after his humiliation was by litle and little exalted to glory, and that in ſundry reſpects according to both his natures.</p>
            <p>The exaltation of his diuine nature, is an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant declaration of his diuine properties in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, without the leaſt alteration thereof. Rom. 1.4. <hi>Declared mightily to be the ſonne of God, touching the ſpirite of ſanctification by the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> Act. 2.36. <hi>God hath made him both Lord and Chriſt, whom ye haue crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The exaltation of his humanitie, is the putting off from him his ſeruile condition, and all infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; the putting on of ſuch habituall gifts, which albeit they are created and finite, yet they haue ſo great and ſo maruelous perfection, as poſsibly can be aſcribed to any creature. The gifts of his mind, are wiſedome, knowledge, ioy, and other vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vertues of his bodie, immortalitie, ſtrength, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilitie, vprightneſſe. Phil. 3.21. <hi>Who ſhall change our vile bodie, that it may be faſhioned like vnto his glorious bodie.</hi> Matth. 17.2. <hi>He was transfigured before them, and his face did ſhine as the ſunne, and his clothes were
<pb facs="tcp:5274:35"/>
as white as the light.</hi> Heb. 1.9. <hi>God euen thy God hath annointed thee with oyle of gladneſſe aboue thy fellowes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſts bodie, although it be thus glorified, yet is it ſtill of a ſolide ſubſtance compaſſed about, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, palpable and ſhall perpetually remaine in ſome certaine place. Luc. 24.39. <hi>Behold my hands, and my feete, it is euen I, touch me, and ſee: A ſpirite hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me haue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be three degrees of Chriſts exaltation.</p>
            <p n="1">I. His reſurrection, wherein by his diuine power he ſubdued death, &amp; raiſed vp himſelfe to eternall life. 2. Cor. 13 4. <hi>Though he was crucified concerning his infirmitie, yet liueth he through the power of God.</hi> Mat. 38.6. <hi>He is not here, for he is riſen, as he ſayde, come ſee the place where the Lord was layde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The end of Chriſts reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was to ſhew that his ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by his paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; death, was fully abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. For one only ſin wold haue deteined the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator vnder the dominion of death, though he had fully ſatisfied for al the reſt. 1. Cor. 15.17. <hi>If Chriſt be not raiſed, your faith is in vaine: ye are yet in your ſins.</hi> Rom. 4.25. <hi>Who was deliuered to death for our ſinnes, and is riſen againe for our iuſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. His aſcention into heauen, which is a true, locall, and viſible tranſlation of Chriſtes humane nature from earth into the higheſt heauen of the Bleſſed by the vertue and power of his deitie. Act. 1.9. <hi>When he had ſpoken theſe thinges, while they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, he was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp: for a cloud tooke him vp out of their ſight: And while they looked ſtedfaſtly towards heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he went, behold two men ſtood by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in white apparell,

            </p>
            <p n="3">III.

Heb. 1.3. <hi>By himſelf he hath purged our ſins, and ſitteth at the eight hand of the maieſtie in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt places.</hi> Pſal. 110.1. <hi>The Lord ſayde vnto my Lord ſit thou at my right hande, till I make thine enemies thy footeſtoole.</hi> 1.

            </p>
            <p>His Regall office hath two parts. The firſt is his rigiment of the Kingdome of heauen, part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is in heauen, part vppon the earth, namely the congregation of the faithfull.</p>
            <p>In the gouernment of his Church he exerciſeth two prerogatiues royall. The firſt is to make lawes. Ia. 4.12. <hi>Ther is one lawgiuer which is able to ſaue &amp; to

            <p>Chriſts gouernment of the Church, is either his collection of it out of the worlde, or conſeruation being collected. Eph. 4.12. Pſal. 10.</p>
            <p>The ſecond parte of his Regall office, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the kingdome of darkenes.

            <p>The kingdome of darknes, is the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Chriſts enemies.</p>
            <p>The Prince of this kingdome, and of all the members thereof, is the deuill.

               <hi>Chap. 19.</hi> Concerning the outward meanes of Executing the decree of election, and of the Decalogue.</head>
            <p>AFter the foundation of election, which hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto bene deliuered, it followeth, that we ſhould entreat of the outward means of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The meanes are Gods couenant, and the ſeale thereof.</p>
            <p>Gods couenant, is his contract with man, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning life eternall, vpon certain conditions.</p>
            <p>This couenant conſiſteth of two partes: Gods promiſe to man, Mans promiſe to God.</p>
            <p>Gods promiſe to man, is that, wherby he bindeth himſelfe to man to be his God, if he breake not the condition.</p>
            <p>Mans promiſe to God, is that, whereby he vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his allegiance vnto his Lord, and to perfourme the condition between them.</p>
            <p>Againe, there are two kindes of this couenaunt. The couenant of works, and the couenant of grace. Iere. 31.31, 32, 33. <hi>Beholde, the dayes come ſaith the Lord, that I will make a newe couenaunt with the houſe of Iſraell, and with the houſe of Iudah, Not according to the couenaunt that I made with their Fathers, when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt: the which my couenaunt they brake although I was husband to them, ſaith the Lord. But this ſhalbe the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that I wil make with the houſe of Iſrael: after thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:5274:38"/>
dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my lawe in their inward partes, and write it in their harts, and will be their God, and they ſhalbe my people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The couenant of works, is Gods couenant, made with condition of perfect obedience, and is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the morrall Law.</p>
            <p>The Morrall Law, is that parte of Gods woord, which commandeth perfect obedience vnto man, as well in his nature, as in his actions, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the contrarie. Rom. 10.5. <hi>Moſes thus deſcribeth the righteouſnes which is of the Law, that the man which doth theſe things, ſhall liue therby.</hi> 1. Tim. 1.5. <hi>The end of the commaundements, is loue aut of a pure ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, and of a good conſcience, and faith vnfained.</hi> Luk. 16.27. <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God, with all thine hart, with all thy ſoule, and with all thy ſtrength.</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>We knowe that the Law is ſpirituall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law hath two partes. The Edict, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding obedience, and the condition binding to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The condition, is eternall life to ſuch as fulfill the Lawe: but to tranſgreſſors, euerlaſting death.</p>
            <p>The Decalogue or ten commaundements, is an abridgement of the whole Lawe, and the couenant of workes. Exo. 34.27. <hi>And the Lord ſaid vnto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, write thou theſe woordes, for after the tenor of theſe words, I haue made a couenant with thee, and with Jſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. And was there with the Lord forty dayes, and forty nights, and did neither eate bread, nor drinke water, and he wrote in the Tables the wordes of the couenant, euen the ten commaundements.</hi> 1. King. 8.9. <hi>Nothing was in
<pb facs="tcp:5274:38"/>
the Arke, ſaue the two Tables of Stone, which Moſes had put there at Horeb, where the Lord made a couenaunt with the Children of Iſraell, when he brought them out of the Land of Egipt.</hi> Matth. 22.40. <hi>On theſe two Commaundementes hangeth the whole Lawe and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The true interpretation of the Decalogue, muſt be according to theſe rules.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In the negatiue, the affirmatiue muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: and in the affirmatiue, the negatiue.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Negatiue, bindeth at all times, and to all times: but the affirmatiue bindeth at all times, but not to all times: and therfore negatiues are of more force.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Vnder one vice expreſſely forbidden, are comprehended all of that kinde, yea, the leaſt cauſe occaſion, or entiſement thereto, is aſwel forbidden, as that. 1. Ioh. 3.15. <hi>VVhoſoeuer hateth his brother, is a manſlayer.</hi> Mat. 5.21. to the end. Euill thoughtes are condemned, as well as euill actions.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The ſmalleſt ſinnes are entituled with the ſame names, that that ſinne is, which is expreſſelye forbidden in that commaundement, to which they appertaine. As in the former places, hatred is named murther, and to looke after a woman with a luſting eye, is adulterie.</p>
            <p>The Decalogue, is deſcribed in two Tables.</p>
            <p>The ſumme of the firſte Table, is, that we loue God vvith our minde, memorie, affections, and all our ſtrength, Mat. 22.37. <hi>This is the firſt,</hi> (to wit, in nature and order) <hi>and great commaundement,</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

            <p>The firſt, teacheth vs to haue and chooſe the true God for our God. The words are theſe.</p>
            <p>

               <head>The Reſolution.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>J am.</hi> If any man rather iudge, that theſe wordes are a preface to all the commaundementes, then a parte of the firſt, I hinder him not: Neuertheles, it is like, that they are a perſwaſion to the keeping of the firſt commaundement: and that they are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, to make way vnto it: as being more hard to be receiued, then the reſt. And this may appeare, in that the three commaundements next following, haue their ſeuerall reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iehouah.</hi> Namely, ſuch one, as from all eternitie, was of, and in himſelfe, cauſing all things to be, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were not, partly by creating, partlye by gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them. Here beginneth the firſt reaſon of the firſte commaundement, taken from the name of God: it is thus framed.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>He that is Iehouah, muſt alone be thy God.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>But I am Jehouah:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Therfore J alone muſt be thy God.</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <p>The propoſition is wanting: the aſſumption is
<pb facs="tcp:5274:39"/>
in theſe words <hi>(J am Jehouah)</hi> the concluſion is the commaundement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy God.</hi> Theſe are the wordes of the couenant of grace. Iere. 32.33. Whereby the Lord promiſeth to his people, remiſsion of ſinnes, and eternall life. Theſe woordes are as a ſecond reaſon of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, drawen from the equalitie of that relation, which is between God and his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If J be thy God, thou againe muſt be my people, and take me alone for thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But J am thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore thou muſt be my people, and take me alone for thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The aſſumption or ſecond part of this reaſon, is confirmed by an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t taken from Gods effects, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he deliuered his people out of Egipt, as it were, from the ſeruitude of a moſte tirannous maiſter. This deliuery was not appropriate onely to the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, but in ſome ſorte to the Church of God in all ages: in that it was a tipe of a more ſurpaſsing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery, from that fearefull kingdome of darkenes, 1. Cor. 10.1, 2. <hi>J would not haue you ignorant, bretheren, that all our Fathers were vnder the cloude, and all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the red Sea, and were all baptized vnto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the cloude, and in the Sea,</hi> Coloſ. 1.13. <hi>Who hath deliuered vs from the power of darkenes, and tranſlated vs into the kingdome of his deere Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Other Gods, or ſtrange Gods.</hi> They are ſo called, not that they by nature are ſuch, or can be, but becauſe the corrupt, and more then diueliſh hart of carnall man eſteemeth ſo of them. Philip. 3.19. <hi>Whoſe God
<pb facs="tcp:5274:40"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before my fate.</hi> That is, (figuratiuely) in my ſight or preſence to whome the ſecret imaginations of the hart are knowen: and this is the third reaſon of the firſt commaundement as if he ſhould ſaye, If thou in my preſence reiect me, it is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Make choice of Jehouah to be thy God.</hi> The duties here commaunded, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">I. To acknowledge God, that is, to know and confeſſe him, to be ſuch a God, as he hath reueiled himſelfe to be in his worde, and creatures. Col. 1.10. <hi>Increaſing in the knowledge of God.</hi> Iere. 24.7. <hi>And I will giue them an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">II. An vnion with God, wherby man is knit in hart to God.

                  </gap>ayes: in affiance, in loue, and feare of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5274:40"/>Affiance, is that, whereby a man acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the power and mercy of GOD, and in him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all aſſaultes whatſoeuer, doth ſtedfaſtlye reſt himſelfe. 2. Chro. 20.20. <hi>Put your truſt in the Lord your God, and ye ſhalbe aſſured, beleeue his Prophets, and ye ſhall proſper.</hi> Pſal. 27.1. <hi>God is my light, and my ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom ſhould J feare?

               </p>
               <p>Hence ariſeth patience, and alacritie in preſent perils. Pſal. 39.19. <hi>J ſhould haue bene dumbe, and not opened my mouth, becauſe thou diddeſt it.</hi> 2. Sam. 16.10. <hi>The King ſaid, what haue J to doo with you, ye Sonnes of Zeruiah? Jf he curſed, becauſe the Lord ſaide curſe Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, what is he that dare ſay, why dooſt thou ſo?</hi> Gen. 45.5. <hi>Be not ſadde, neither greeued with your ſelues, that ye ſolde me hither: for God did ſend me before you, for your preſeruation.</hi> ver. 8. <hi>Now then, you ſent me not, but God himſelfe.</hi> 2. Kings. 6.16. <hi>Feare not, for they that be with vs, are moe, then they, that be with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This affiance engendreth hope, which is a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent exſpectation of Gods preſence and aſsiſtance, in all things that are to come. Pſalm. 37.5. <hi>Commit thy way vnto the Lord, and truſt in him, and he ſhal bring it to paſſe.</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>Waeite patiently vpon the Lord, and hope in him.</hi> Pro. 16.3. <hi>Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lord, and thy thoughts ſhalbe directed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The loue of God, is that, whereby man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging Gods goodnes and fauour towardes him, doth again loue him aboue al things. Deut. 6.5.
<pb facs="tcp:5274:41"/>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God, with all thine hart, with all thy ſoule, and with al thy ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The marks of the true loue of God, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">I. To heare willinglye his woorde. II. To ſpeake often of him. III. To think often of him. IIII. To doo his will without irkeſomnes. V. To giue bodye, and all for his cauſe. VI. To deſire his preſence aboue all, and to bewaile his abſence. VII. To embrace all ſuch thinges as appertaine to him. VIII. To loue and hate that, which he loueth and hateth. IX. In all thinges to ſeeke to pleaſe him. X. To drawe others vnto the loue of him. XI. To eſteeme lightly of ſuch giftes and graces as he beſtoweth. XII. To ſtaye our ſelues vpon his counſailes reueiled in his word. Laſtly, to call vpon his name with affiance.</p>
               <p>The feare of God, is that wherby man, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging Gods both mercye and iuſtice, dooth, as it were a capitall crime, feare to diſpleaſe God. Pſal. 130.3. <hi>With thee is mercie, that thou maiſt be feared.</hi> Haba. 3.16. <hi>When I heard it, my bellye trembled, my lyps ſhooke at the voice: rottennes entred into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelfe, that I might reſt in the daye of trouble, when he commeth vp againſt the people to deſtroy them.</hi> Pſal. 4.4. <hi>Tremble and ſinne not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence ariſeth the godly mans deſire, to approue himſelfe in all thinges to his God. Gen. 5.22. <hi>And Henoch walked with GOD, after that, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 17.1. <hi>God ſaide to him, I am all ſufficient, walke before me and be thou perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of theſe three former vertues, proceedeth
<pb facs="tcp:5274:41"/>
humilitye, where by a man acknowledging Gods free bounty, and proſtrating himſelfe before him, dooth aſcribe vnto him all praiſe and glory. 1. Cor. 1.13. <hi>Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord.</hi> 1. Pet. 15.5. <hi>Decke your ſelues inwardlye with lowlines of minde, for God reſiſteth the proude, and giueth grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Verſe. 6. <hi>Humble your ſelues therefore vnder the mighty hand of God, that he may exalte you in due time.</hi> 1, Chron, 29.10.11. <hi>And Dauid ſaide, Bleſſed be thou O Lord God of Iſraell our fathers for euer, and Thine, O Lord, is greatnes, and power, and glorye, and victorye, and prayſe: for all that is in heauen, and in earth is thine, &amp;c.</hi> And verſe 14. <hi>But who am I, and what is my people, that we ſhould be able to offer willinglye on this ſort, for all things come of thee, and of thine own hand we haue giuen thee, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Chap. 21.</hi> Of the ſecond Commaundement.</head>
            <p>HItherto haue we entreated of the firſte Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, teaching vs to entertaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our heartes, and to make choice of one onely God. The other three of the firſte Table, concerne that holy profeſsion, which we muſt make towards the ſame god. For firſt, it is neceſſary to make choiſe of the true God. Secondly, to make profeſsion of God.</p>
            <p>In the profeſsion of God, we are to conſider the partes thereof, and the time appointed for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion.</p>
            <p>The partes are two. The ſolemne worſhipping of God, and the glorifying of him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond commaundement deſcribeth ſuch holy and ſolemne worſhip, as is due vnto God. The words of the commaundement are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt make thee no gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them, for I am the Lord thy God, a beloue God, viſiting the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the children, vpon the third generation, and vpon the fourth of them that hate me, and ſhewing mercie vnto thouſandes, vpon them that loue me and keepe my commaundements.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The reſolution.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not make.</hi> This is the firſt part of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, forbidding to make an idoll: Now an idoll is not onely a certaine repreſentation, and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, of ſome feigned God, but alſo of the true Iehoua. The which may be proued againſt the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes by theſe arguments. The firſt is Deut. 4.15.16. <hi>Take therefore good heeds vnto your ſelues, for ye ſaw no image in the day that the Lorde ſpake vnto you in Horeb, out of the middes of the fire, that ye corrupt not your ſelues, and make you a grauen image or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of any figure: whether it be the likeneſſe of male of female.</hi> Out of the words vttered by Moſes, a reaſon may be framed thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ye ſaw no image (namely of God) ye ſhal make none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ye ſaw no image, onely ye heard a voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore ye ſhall make no image of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon: That idolatrie which the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites committed, the very ſame is prohibited in this commaundement.</p>
               <p>But the Iſraelites idolatrie was the worſhip of God in an image. Hoſeah. 2.16. <hi>At that day, ſaith the Lord, thou ſhalt call me no more Baali, but ſhalt call me Iſhe.</hi> Exod. 32.5. <hi>Aaron proclaimed, ſaying, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhall be the holy day to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the worſhipping of God is an image,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:45"/>
is here prohibited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Any grauen image.</hi> Here the more ſpeciall is put for the more generall, namely, a grauen image for all counterfeit meanes of Gods worſhip.</p>
               <p>The firſt part of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement is here illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, by a double diſtribution. The firſt is drawn from the cauſes. <hi>Thou ſhalt not make thee any idol, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther it be engrauen in wood, or ſtone: or whether it be painted in a table.</hi> The ſecond is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place. <hi>Thou ſhalt not make thee an idoll of things in heauen, as ſtarres, and birdes: or in the earth, as of man, woman, beaſtes: or vnder the earth, as fiſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This place is ſo expounded by Moſes. Deut. 4.14. to the 20. verſ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhall not bow downe to them.</hi> This is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the commaundement, forbidding all men to fall downe before an idoll. In this worde, <hi>bowe downe,</hi> is againe the ſpeciall put for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: for in it is inhibited all feigned worſhippe of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For</hi> I. Theſe words are a confirmation of this commaundement, perſwading to obedience, by foure reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord (which is ſtrong.)</hi> The firſt reaſon, God is ſtrong, &amp; ſo able to reuenge idolatry. Heb. 10.31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aielous God.</hi> This ſpeech is taken from the eſtate of wedlocke, for God is called the husband of his Church. Eſay. 54.5. Epheſ. 5.26, 27. and our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall worſhippe is, as it were a certaine marriage of our ſoules, conſecrated vnto the Lorde. Ierm. 2.2. <hi>I remember thee with the kindneſſe of thy youth, and
<pb facs="tcp:5274:45"/>
the loue of thy marriage, when thou wenteſt after me in the wildernes, in a land that was not ſowen.</hi> Here is an other argument drawen from a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of things that be like. Gods people muſt alone worſhip him, becauſe they are linked to him as a wife is to her husband, vnto whome alone ſhe is bound: therfore if his people forſake him, and betroth them ſelues vnto idols, he will vndoubtedly giue them a bill of diuorcement, and they ſhall be no more eſpouſed vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viſuing.</hi> To viſite, is not only to puniſh the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for the fathers offences, but to take notice, &amp; apprehend them in the ſame faults: by reaſon they are giuen ouer to commit their fathers tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that for them they may be puniſhed. And this is the third reaſon drawen from the effects of gods anger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hate me.</hi> It may be, this is a ſecret aunſwere, the obiection wherof is not here in expreſſe woordes ſet downe, but may be thus framed. <hi>What if we vſe idols to inflame, and exite in vs a loue and remembrance of thee.</hi> The aunſwere is this by the contrary: <hi>You may think that your vſe of idoles kindleth in you a loue of mee, but it is ſo farre from that, that all ſuch as vſe them cannot chooſe but hate me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shew mercy.</hi> The fourth reaſon deriued from the effects of Gods mercy to ſuch as obſerue this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. Here may we firſt obſerue that gods mercy exceedeth his iuſtice. Pſalme. 103.8. <hi>The Lord is full of compaſsion and mercy, ſlowe to anger and of greate kindeneſſe.</hi> verſe. 17. <hi>The louing kindneſſe of
<pb facs="tcp:5274:46"/>
the Lord endureth for euer.</hi> ver. 9. <hi>He will not alwayes chide, neither keepe his anger for euer.</hi> Secondly we may not ſurmiſe, that this excellent promiſe is made to euery one particularly, who is borne of faithful parents. For godly Iſaak had godleſſe Eſau to his ſonne, and godleſſe Saul, had godly Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</p>

                  <hi>Thou ſhalt neither worſhip falſe Gods, nor the true God with a falſe worſhippe.</hi> Many thinges are here forbidden.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The repreſentation of God, by an image. For it is a lie. Habak. 2.18. <hi>What profiteth the image? for the maker thereof hath made it an image and a teacher of lies.</hi> Zach. 10.2. <hi>The idoles haue ſpoken vanitie.</hi> Ier. 10.8. <hi>The ſtocke is a doctrine of vanitie.</hi> The Eliber Councel in the 39. canon hath this edict. <hi>We thought it not meete to haue images in Churches, leſt that which is worſhipped and adored, ſhould be painted vpon walles.</hi> Clement. booke 5. ad Iacob.

Pſal.</p>
               <p>The image alſo of the croſſe and Chriſt crucified, ought to be aboliſhed out of churches, as the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſerpent was. 2. King. 18.4. Hezekiah is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for breaking in peeces the braſen ſerpent, to which the children of Iſrael did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> burne incenſe.

was made by the Lordes appointment. Nomb. 21.8. and was a type of Chriſtes paſsion. Ioh. 3.14. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen in his 7. booke againſt Celſus. <hi>We permit not any to adore Ieſus vpon the alters, in images, or vpon church walles: becauſe it is written, thou ſhalt haue none other gods but me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Epiphanius, in that Epiſtle which he wrote to Iohn Biſhop of Hieruſalem, <hi>ſayth it is againſt the cuſtome of the Church to ſee any image hanging in the church, whether it be of Chriſt, or any other ſaint, and therefore euen with his owne handes rent he a ſunder the vaile, wherein ſuch an image was painted.</hi>

               <p>Neither ſerue the cherubimes, which Salomon placed in the temple, for the defence of images: for they were onely in the holy of holieſt, where the people could not ſee them. And they were types of the glory of the Meſsiah, vnto whom the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were ſubiect: the which we haue now verified in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If any man reply, that they worſhippe not the image, but God in the image: let him knowe that the creature can not comprehend the image of the creator, and if it could, yet God would not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in it, becauſe it is a dead thing: yea the

               <p>If any man be yet deſirous of images, he may haue at hand the preaching of the goſpell, a liuely image of Chriſt crucified. Gal. 3.1. <hi>O fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you that ye ſhould not obey the truth, to whome Ieſus Christ before was deſcribed in your ſight, and among you crucified?</hi> The like may be ſaid of the two Sacraments.

               <p n="2">II. The leaſt approbation of idolatry. Hoſ. 13.2. <hi>They ſay one to another whileſt they ſacrifice a man, let them kiſſe the calues.</hi> Now a kis, is an externall ſigne of ſome allowance of a thing. Gen. 48.11.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is vnlawfull to be preſent at Maſſe, or any idolatrous ſeruice, though our minds be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. 1. Cor. 6.20. <hi>Ye are bought with a price, therfore glorifie God in your body, and in your ſperites, which are Gods.</hi> Rom. 11.4. <hi>What ſaith the Scripture? I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued vnto my ſelfe ſeuen thouſand men, which haue not bowed the knee to Baal.</hi> Euſeb. 3. book. <hi>The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, when they were haled vnto the Temples of idoles, cried out, and with a loud voice in the middes of their

               <p>That which may be obiected of Naaman the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, who woorſhiped in the Temple of Rimmon, is thus anſwered, that he did it not with purpoſe to commit idolatrie, but to performe that ciuil obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, which he was wont to exhibit to the Kings Maieſtie. 2.

               <p>And for this cauſe are vtterly forbidden all ſuch.</p>
               <p>Proceſsions, plaies, and ſuch feaſtes, as are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the memorial and honour of Idoles.

               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Societie with infidels, is here vnlawfull, that ſerueth not onely to maintaine concord, but alſo to ioyne men in brotherly loue. Of this ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, there are many branches.</p>
               <p>The firſt, is Marriage with infidels. Gen. 6.2. <hi>The ſonnes of God ſaw the daughters of men, that they were faire, and they tooke them wiues of all that they liked.</hi> Malac. 2.11. <hi>Iudah hath tranſgreſſed, and an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is committed in Iſrael, and in Ieruſalem: for Iudah hath defiled the holineſſe of the Lord, which he loued, and hath married the daughters of a ſtrange god.</hi> Ezra. 9.14. <hi>Should we returne to breake thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, and ioyne in affinitie with the people of ſuch abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> 2. King. 8.18. <hi>He walked in the wayes of the kings of Iſrael, as did the houſe of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did euill in the ſight of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond, is the league in warre: namely, a mutuall confederacie, to aſsiſt one another in the ſame warre, and to haue one and the ſame enemies. This is ſundry wayes impious. I. If it be vnlawfull to craue aſsiſtance of Gods enemies, it is likewiſe
<pb facs="tcp:5274:48"/>
vnlawfull to indent with them, that we will aſsiſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. II. It obſcureth Gods glory, as though he him ſelf, either would not, or could not aide his church. III. It is a thouſande to one, leaſt we be infected with their idolatrie, and other impieties. IV. It endangereth vs to be made partakers of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. V. 2. Chron. 19.2. <hi>And Iehu the ſonne of Hauanas the Seer, went out to meete him, and ſaide to King Iehoſhaphat, wouldeſt thou helpe the wicked, and loue them that hate the Lord? therefore for this thing is the wrath of the Lord vpon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third, is Traffique: as when a man witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and willingly, doth, in hope to enrich him ſelfe, make ſale of ſuch things, as he knoweth, muſt ſerue to an idolatrous vſe. This condemneth all thoſe marchantes, which tranſport to idolatours, and ſell them frankincenſe, waxe, cloth, or other ſuch thinges as helpe them in the ſeruice of their idols.</p>
               <p>The fourth, is triall of ſutes in Law before Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which are infidels. 1. Cor. 9.6. <hi>Brother goeth to law with brother, and that vnder infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth, is the worſhipping of the beaſt, and receiuing his marke. Reuel. 14.9. <hi>If any man worſhip the beaſt, and his image, and receiue the marke in his forehead, or on his hand</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>The ſame ſhall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God.</hi> This beaſt is the Church of Rome, I meane not that old, but this new Rome, now no better then an hereticall, and apoſtaticall Synagogue.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Wilworſhippe, when God is worſhipped
<pb facs="tcp:5274:49"/>
with a naked and bare good intention, not warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the word of God. Coloſſ. 2.23. <hi>Which things in deede haue a ſhew of wiſedome in voluntarie religion, and humbleneſſe of minde, and in not ſparing the bodie: neither haue they it in any eſtimation to ſatisfie the fleſh.</hi> 1. Sam. 13.9, 10. <hi>And Saul ſayde, Bring a burne offring to me, and peace offrings: &amp; he offered a burnt offering. And aſſoone as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came, and</hi> ver. 13. <hi>ſaid to Saul, thou hast done fooliſhly, thou haſt not kept the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lord God, which he commaunded thee.</hi> Hitherto may we adde popiſh ſuperſtitions in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, meates, holydayes, apparell, temporarie and beadridden prayers, indulgences, auſter life, whippings, ceremonies, geſtures, gate, conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pilgrimage, building of Altars, pictures, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and all other of that rabble.</p>
               <p>To theſe may be added, conſort, muſicke in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice, feeding the eares, not edifying the minde. 1. Corinth. 14.15. <hi>What is it then? I will pray with the ſpirite, but I will pray with the vnderſtanding alſo. I will ſing with the ſpirite, but I will ſing with the vnderſtanding alſo.</hi> Iuſtinus Martyr in his booke of Chriſtian Quaeſt. and Anſ. 107. <hi>It is not the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Churches, to ſing their meeters with anie ſuch kinde of inſtruments, &amp;c. but their manner is only to vſe plaine ſong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, monaſticall vowes, which I. repugne the Law of God: as that vnchaſte vowe of ſingle life, and proud promiſe of pouertie do plainely euince: <hi>For he that laboureth not, muſt not eate,</hi> ſayth Paule:

They diſanull Chriſtian libertie, and make ſuch thinges neceſſarie, as are indifferent. IIII. They renue Iudaiſme. V. They are idolatrous, becauſe they make them partes of Gods worſhip, and eſteeme them as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Hypocriſie, which giueth to God painted worſhip, that is, if you regard outward behauiour, great ſynceritie: if the inward and heartie affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, none at all. Matth. 15.7. <hi>Hypocrites, well hath Eſaias prophecied of you, ſaying, This people commeth neere me with their mouth, &amp; honor me with their lips, but their heart is farre from me.</hi> Pſal. 10.4. <hi>The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man is ſo proud, that he ſeeketh not for God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The effects of hypocriſie, are theſe. I. To ſeeke the pompe and glory of the world, &amp; by all meanes to enrich it ſelfe, notwithſtanding it make a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhew of the ſeruice of God. II. It is ſharpe ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and hath eagles eies to obſerue other mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, when in the regarding his owne, it is as blind as a beetle. III. To be more curious in the obſeruation of ancient traditions, then the ſtatutes and commandements of almightie God. IV. To ſtumble at a ſtraw and skip ouer a blocke, that is, to omit ſerious affaires, and hunt after trifles. Matth. 23.4. V. To do all thinges that they may be ſeene of men. Matth. 6.5.</p>
               <p>Popiſh faſting, is meere hypocriſie: becauſe it

               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. Contempt, neglect, and intermiſsion of Gods ſeruice. Reuel. 3.15, 16. <hi>I know thy workes, that thou art neither cold nor hote, J would thou wereſt cold or hote.

               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Corrupting of Gods worſhip, and that order of gouernement, which he hath ordeined for his Church: the which is done, when any thing is added, detracted, or any way, againſt his preſcript, mangled. Deut. 12.32. <hi>Euery thing which I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand you, that do: neither adde to it, nor detract from it.</hi> This condemneth that Popiſh eleuation of bread in the Lordes ſupper, and the adminiſtration of it alone to the people without wine, together with that fearefull abomination of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>By this, we may learne to reiect all popiſh tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Matth. 15.9. <hi>In vaine doe they worſhip me, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching for doctrines, mens precepts.</hi> Now it is manifeſt,

                  </gap> whereas the Scriptures contayned in the Olde and New Teſtament, are all ſufficient, not onely to confirme doctrines, but alſo to conforme man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. 2. Timothie 3.16. <hi>The whole Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue, to correct, and to instruct in righteouſneſſes that the man of God may be abſolute, being made perfect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all good workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Romiſh Hierarchie is here alſo condemned; from the pardoner to the Pope: the gouernement whereof, is an expreſſe image of the old Romaine Empire, whether we conſider the regiment it ſelfe, or the place of the Empire, or the large circuite of that gouernement. Reuel. 13.15. <hi>And it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, to giue a ſpirite to the image of the beaſt, ſo that the image of the beaſt ſhould ſpeake, and ſhould cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the image of the beaſt, ſhould be killed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. A religious reuerence of the creature, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we attribute more vnto him, then we ought.

               <p>This teacheth vs plainly, that inuocation of anie creature is vnlawfull: for we muſt pray to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that are able to know the ſecrets of the hart, &amp; diſcerne the wiſedome of the ſpirite: now none is able to do that, but ſuch a nature as is omnipotent.

               <p>Neuertheleſſe, ſuch as are Saints indeede, are to be honoured by an approbation of Gods giftes in them, and by an honourable mention of them, and alſo by imitation of their maners and liues, being as paterns for vs to walke after.</p>

               <p>Magicke, is either coniecturall, or operatiue.</p>
               <p>Coniecturall, whereby things are by Satans di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection propheſied of before. Of Propheſies, ſome are done with meanes, others without.</p>
               <p>Propheſies done with meanes, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Soothſaying, diuination by the flying of birdes. Deut. 18.11.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The kinde of diuination, which is, by loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into beaſts entrals. Ezech. 21.21. <hi>The king of Babel, &amp;c. conſulted with idols, and looked in the liuer.</hi>

               <p>Diuining without meanes, is, when ſuch as are poſſeſſed with an vncleane ſpirite, vſe immediatly the helpe of the ſame ſpirite, to reueile ſecrets.

               </p>
               <p>Magicke operatiue hath two partes. Iuggling, and Inchantments.</p>
               <p>Iuggling, whereby through the deuils conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, many great &amp; very hard matters, are in ſhew effected.

               <p>They which ſpread abroad by their writings or otherwiſe, that witches are nothing elſe, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike doting women, who through the deuils deluſion, ſuppoſe, that they themſelues doo that, which indeed the deuill doth alone: albeit they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour cunningly to cloak this ſin, yet by the ſame meanes they may defend murther, adulterye, and

               <p>Thou ſhalt worſhip God in ſpirite and trueth.

Heb. 4.2. <hi>The word that they heard, profited not them, becauſe it was not mixed with faith in thoſe that heard it.</hi> Pſalm. 26.6. <hi>I will waſh mine hands in innocency, O Lord, and ſo come before thine alter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. The helpes and furtherances of true woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe, are two: Vowes, and faſting: and they are not to be taken, as the woorſhippe of God it ſelfe. For we may not obtrude any thing to God, as good ſeruice, and as though it did binde the conſcience, except he haue ordeined it for that end &amp; purpoſe.</p>
               <p>A vowe, in the new Teſtament, is a promiſe to God, with a full intent to obſerue ſome corporall and externall dueties, which a Chriſtan hath on his owne accorde, without iniunction, impoſed vpon himſelfe, that he may therby the better be excited vnto repentance, meditation, ſobrietie, abſtinence, patience, and thankfulnes towardes God. Gen. 28.20. <hi>Then Iaacob vowed a vow ſaying, if God wilbe with me, and will keep me in this iourney, which I goe, and will
<pb facs="tcp:5274:55"/>
giue me bread to eate, and clothes to put on; ſo that I come againe to my fathers houſe in ſafetie, then ſhall the Lord be my God, and this ſtone which I haue ſet vp as a piller, ſhalbe Gods houſe, and of all that thou ſhalt giue me, I will giue the tenth to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In vowing, we haue theſe thinges to obſerue. 1. We muſt not vow that which is vnlawfull. 2. We ought not to vow the performance of that, which is contrarye to our vocation. 3. Vowes muſt be of that which we can doo. 4. They muſt be farre from ſo much as a conceite of merite, or worſhip of God. 5. We muſt ſo performe our vowes, as that they encroche not vpon Chriſtian libertye, giuen vs in Chriſt: for we are bounden to paye our vowes, no longer then the cauſes thereof remaine, and ought to be obſerued. Deut. 23.18. <hi>Thou ſhalt neither bring the hyre of a whore, nor the price of a dog, into the houſe of the Lord thy God, for any vow.</hi> verſe 21. <hi>When thou ſhalt vow a vow vnto the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt not be ſlacke to pay it: for the Lord thy God will ſurelye require it of thee: But when thou abſteineſt from vowing, it ſhall be no ſin vnto thee. &amp;c.</hi> ver. 23.

               </p>
               <p>Faſting is, when a man perceiuing the want of ſome bleſsing, or ſuſpecting and ſeeing ſome immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent calamitie vpon himſelfe, or other, abſteineth, not onely from fleſh for a ſeaſon, but alſo from all delights and ſuſtenance, that he thereby may make a more diligent ſearch into his own ſinnes, or offer moſte humble prayers vnto God, that hee would withhold that, which his anger thretned. Mat. 9.15.
<pb facs="tcp:5274:56"/>
                  <hi>Can the Children of the marriage Chamber mourne, ſo long as the Bridegrome is with them?</hi> 1. Corinthians 7.5. <hi>Defraude not one another, except for a time, that ye may the better faſt and pray.</hi> Ioel. 2.12. <hi>Wherfore euen now, ſaith the Lord, be yee turned vnto me, with al your hart, with faſting and prayer.</hi> verſ. 13. <hi>Rent your hartes and not your garmentes, and turne vnto the Lord your God, for he is gracious and mercifull, long ſuffering, and of great kindenes, that he might repent him of this euill.</hi> verſ. 15. <hi>Blowe the trumpet in Syon, ſanctifie a faſt, call a ſolemne aſſemblye,</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>Gather the people, ſanctifie the Congregation, gather the Elders, aſſemble the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thoſe that ſucke the breaſtes. Let the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome goe foorth of his Chamber, and the bride out of her bride chamber:</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>Let the prieſtes, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Lord, weepe betweene the porche and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and let them ſay, Spare thy people, O God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A faſt is ſometimes priuate, ſomtimes publike. 2. Chronicles 20..3 <hi>Iehoſhaphat feared, and ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſeeke the Lord, and proclaimed a faſt throughout all Iudah.</hi> Heſter. 4.16. <hi>Faſt ye for me, and neither eat nor drinke for the ſpace of three dayes and nights, I alſo and my maides will faſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A faſt is either for one day alone, or for manye daies together. Iud. 20.23. <hi>The children of Iſrael had gone vp and wept before the Lord vnto the euening; &amp;c.</hi> Dan. 10.3. <hi>I Daniel was in heauines for three weeks of dayes, J eate no pleaſant bread, neither, came fleſhe nor wine in my mouth, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Leagues of amitie among ſuch as feare God according to his word, are lawfull: as contractes in Matrimony, league in warre, eſpecially if the warre

               <p>To thoſe may be added that couenant which the Magiſtrates and people make among themſelues, and with God for the preſeruation of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. 2.

For we are not to vſe Lottes but with great reuerence: in that the diſpoſition of them immediatlye commeth from the Lorde, and their proper vſe is to decide great controuerſies.

               <p n="10">X. Superſtition, which is an opinion conceiued of the woorks of Gods prouidence: the reaſon whereof, can neither be drawen out of the word of GOD, nor the whole courſe of nature. As for example, that it is vnlucky for one in the morning to put on his ſhoe awrye, or to put the left ſhoe on the right foot, to ſneeze in drawing on his ſhoes, to haue ſalt fall towarde him, to haue an hare croſſe him, to bleede ſome fewe droppes of blood, to
<pb facs="tcp:5274:59"/>
burne on the right eare. Againe, that it is contrarily good luck to finde olde yron, to haue drinke ſpilled on him, for the left eare to burne, to pare our nayles on ſome one day in the weeke, to dreame of ſome certain things. The like ſuperſtition is, to ſurmyze that beaſtes may be tamed by verſes prayers, or the like: that the repetition of the creed or Lords prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, can infuſe into hearbes, a facultie of healing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.

               <p n="1">I. The manner and partes of an othe: the partes are in number foure. 1. Confirmation of a trueth. 2 Inuocation of GOD alone, as a witnes of the trueth, and a reuenger of a lye. 3 Confeſsion that God puniſheth periurye, when he is brought in as a falſe witnes. 4.

               <p n="3">III. The end, namely, to confirme ſome neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trueth in queſtion. Heb. 6.16. <hi>Men ſweare by him that is greater then themſelues: and an oathe for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, is among them an end of all ſtrife.</hi> I call that a neceſſarye trueth, when ſome doubt, which muſt neceſſarily be decided, can none other waye be determined then by an othe: as when Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, our neighbours body and goods, or the credite of the party for whom the othe is miniſtred, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilye called into queſtion. Rom. 1.9. <hi>God is my witnes (whome I ſerue in my ſpirite in the Goſpell of his Son) that without ceaſing I make mention of you.</hi> 2. Cor. 1.23. <hi>I call God for a record into my ſoule, that to ſpare you, I came not as yet vnto Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IIII. The diuers kindes of ſorts of othes. An othe is publike, or priuate.</p>
               <p>Publike, when the Magiſtrate, without any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril to him that ſweareth, doth vpon iuſt cauſe exact a teſtimony together with an oth.</p>
               <p>A priuate othe is, which two or more take pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately. This, ſo that it be ſparingly, &amp; warily vſed is lawful. For in ſerious affaires &amp; matters of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:61"/>
it be lawfull in priuate to admit God as a Iudge, why ſhould he not as well be called to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Againe, the examples of holy men ſhewe the practiſe of priuate othes, as not vnlawful. Iacob and Laban confirmed their couenant one with an other by a priuate othe: the like did Booz in his contract with Ruth.</p>
               <p>To this place may be added an <hi>aſſeueration,</hi> the which albeit it be like an oth, yet in deede is none: and is nothing elſe, but a conſtant aſſertion of our minde, interſerting ſometimes the name of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Such was Chriſtes aſſertion, <hi>Verely, verely, I ſay vnto you.</hi> And Pauls, <hi>I call God to recorde in my ſpirite.</hi> Where is both an oth and an aſſeueration. 1. Cor. 15.31. <hi>By your reioycing which I haue in Ieſus Chriſt, I die daily.</hi> 1. Sam. 20.3. <hi>In deede, as the Lord liueth, and as my ſoule liueth, there is but a ſteppe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene me and death.</hi> And truely in ſuch a kinde of aſſeueration there is great equitie: for albeit it be vnlawfull to ſweare by creatures, leaſt Gods honor and power ſhould be attributed vnto them: yet thus farre may we vſe them in an othe, as to make them pledges, and as it were cogniſances of Gods glorie.</p>
               <p>The performance of an oth is on this manner. If the oth made be lawfull, it muſt be performed, be it of much difficultie, great dammage, and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by force. Pſal. 15.4. <hi>He that ſweareth to his owne hinderance and changeth not, he ſhall dwell in Gods ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contrarily, if a man ſweare, to performe things
<pb facs="tcp:5274:62"/>
vnlawfull, and that by ignorance, errour, or infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, his othe is to be recalled. <hi>For we may not adde ſinne vnto ſinne.</hi> 1. Sam. 25.2. <hi>And Dauid ſaide, in deede I haue kept all in vaine, that this fellow had in the wilderneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 22. <hi>So and more alſo doe God vnto the enemies of Dauid: for ſurely I will not leaue of all that he hath, by the dawning of the day, any that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sam. 19.23. Dauid promiſeth that Shimei ſhould not die: but 1. King. 2.9. Dauid ſayth to Salomon, <hi>Though J ſware ſo, yet thou ſhalt not count him innocent, but cauſe his hoare head to goe downe to the graue with bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. Sanctification of Gods creatures &amp; ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the which is a ſeparation of them to an holy vſe. Thus ought we to ſanctifie our meates and drinks, the workes of our calling, and marriage.</p>
               <p>The meanes of this ſanctification are two: Gods word, and prayer. 1. Tim. 4.4. <hi>All which God hath created is good, and nothing muſt be reiected, if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with thankeſgiuing: for it is ſanctified by the word and prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the worde we are inſtructed, firſt, whether God alloweth the vſe of ſuch things or not: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we learne after what holy maner, in what place, at what time, with what affection, and to what end we muſt vſe them. Heb. 11.6. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Pſal. 119.24. <hi>Thy teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are my delight, they are my counſellers.</hi> Ioſua 22.19.29.
<pb facs="tcp:5274:62"/>
1. Sam. 15.23.</p>
               <p>Prayer, which ſanctifieth, is petition and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</p>
               <p>By petition, we obtaine of Gods Maieſtie, aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by his grace, to make an holy vſe of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ordinances. Coloſſ. 3.17. <hi>Whatſoeuer ye ſhall do, in word or deede, do all in the name of the Lord Ieſus, giuing thankes to God euen the father by him.</hi> 1. Sam. 17.45. Then ſayde Dauid to the Philiſtim, <hi>Thou commeſt to me with a ſworde, and with a ſpeare, and with a ſhield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hoſtes, the God of the hoſte of Iſrael, whom thou haſt railed vpon.</hi> Mich. 4.5. <hi>We will walke in the name of the Lorde our God, for euer and euer.</hi> Here may we obſerue prayers made vpon particular occaſion. 1. For a proſperous iourney. Act. 21.5. <hi>When the dayes were ended, we departed, and went our way, and they all accompanied vs with their wiues and children, euen out of the Citie: and we kneeling downe on the ſhore, prayed, &amp;c.</hi> 2. For a bleſsing vpon meates at the table. Ioh. 6.11. <hi>Then Jeſus tooke the bread, and when he had giuen thankes, he gaue it to his diſciples, and the diſciples to them that were ſet downe: and likewiſe of the fiſhes as much as they would.</hi> Act. 27.35. <hi>He tooke breade, and gaue thankes to God, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of them all, and brake it, and beganne to eate.</hi> 3. For iſſue in childbirth. This did Anna. 1. Sam. 1.14. And Zacharie, Luke 1.13. 4. For good ſucceſſe in buſineſſe. Geneſ. 24.12. Abrahams ſeruaunt prayed. Thankeſgiuing is the magnifying of Gods Name, euen the father through Chriſt, for his
<pb facs="tcp:5274:63"/>
grace, ayde, and bleſsing in the lawfull vſe of the creatures. Philip. 4.6. <hi>In all things let your requeſts be ſhewed vnto God, in prayer, and ſupplication, and giuing of thankes.</hi> 1. Theſſ. 5.18. <hi>Jn all thinges giue thankes, for this is the will of God in Christ towards you.</hi> This we may reade vſed, 1. After meate.

After the loſſe of outward wealth.

For deliuerance out of ſeruitude. Exod. 18.10. <hi>Iethro ſayd, Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath deliuered you out of the handes of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hath deliuered the people from vnder the hand of the Egyptians.</hi> 4. For children. Gen. 29.35. <hi>She concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againe and bore a ſonne, ſaying, now will I prayſe the Lord, therefore ſhe called his name Iudah.</hi> 5. For victorie. 2.

               <hi>Chap. 23.</hi> Of the fourth commaundement.</head>
            <p>THe fourth commaundement concerneth the Sabboth: namely, that holy time conſecrated
<pb facs="tcp:5274:63"/>
to the worſhip, and glorifying of God. The words are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remember the Sabboth day to keepe it holy: Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour, and doe all thy worke: but the ſeuenth day is the Sabboth of the Lorde thy God, in it thou ſhalt doe no manner of worke, thou, nor thy ſonne, nor thy daughter, thy man ſeruant, nor thy mayde, nor thy beaſt, nor thy ſtranger that is within thy gates. For in ſixe dayes the Lord made the heauen and the earth, the ſea and all that in them is, and rested the ſeuenth day, therefore the Lorde bleſſed the ſeuenth day, and hallowed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remember.</hi> This clauſe doth inſinuate, that in times paſt there was great neglect in the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabboth: and would that all degrees and conditions of men ſhould prepare themſelues to ſanctifie the ſame: eſpecially thoſe that be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of families, incorporations, and Cities, to whom this commaundement is directed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To keepe it holy, or, to ſanctifie it.</hi> To ſanctifie, is to ſeuer a thing from common vſe, and to conſecrate the ſame to the ſeruice of God. Here are deſcribed the two partes of this commaundement: the firſt whereof, is reſt from labour: the ſecond, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixe dayes.</hi> Theſe wordes containe a cloſe aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to this obiection. It is much to ceaſe from our callings one whole day. The anſwere (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a firſt reaſon to inforce the ſanctification of the Sabboth) is in theſe wordes: it is taken from the greater to the leſſe. <hi>If J permit thee to follow thy

calling ſixe whole dayes, thou maieſt well, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>But the firſt is true. Therefore the ſecond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt propoſition is wanting: the ſecond, or aſſumption are theſe words, <hi>Sixe daies, &amp;c.</hi> The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is the commandement it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Here may we ſee, that God hath giuen vs free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to worke all the ſixe dayes. The which free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, no man can annihilate. Neuertheleſſe, vpon extraordinary occaſions, the Church of God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſeparate one day or more of the ſeuen, as neede is, either to faſting, or a ſolemne day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, for ſome benefite receiued. Ioel. 2.15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſeuenth day.</hi> The ſecond reaſon of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement taken from the end thereof.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>If the Sabboth were conſecrated to God, &amp; his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, we muſt that day abſtaine from our labours.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But it was conſecrated to God, and his ſeruice.</hi>

                  <hi>Therefore we muſt then abſtaine from our labours.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>The aſſumption is in theſe wordes <hi>(the ſeuenth day, &amp;c.)</hi> where we muſt note, that God alone hath this priuiledge, to haue a Sabboth conſecrated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and therefore all holy dayes dedicated to whatſoeuer eyther Angell or Saint, are vnlawfull: howſoeuer the Church of Rome haue impoſed the obſeruation of them vpon many people.</p>

               <hi>Any worke.</hi> That is, any ordinary worke of your callings, and ſuch as may be done the day before, or left well vndone till the day after. Yet for all this we are not forbidden to performe ſuch works euen on this day, as are both holy, and of preſent neceſsitie.</p>
            <p>Such are thoſe workes, which doe vppon that day preſerue and maintaine the ſeruice and glorie of God, as 1. A Sabboth dayes iourney. Act. 1.12. <hi>Which is now to Hieruſalem, containing a Sabboth dayes iourney.</hi> 2. The killing and dreſsing of ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced beaſts in the time of the law. Matt. 12.5. <hi>Haue ye not read in the Law, how that on the Sabboth dayes, the Prieſtes in the Temple breake the Sabboth, &amp; are blameleſſe?</hi> 3. Iourneyes vnto the Prophetes, and places appointed vnto the worſhip of God. 2. king. 4.23. <hi>He ſaide, Why wilt thou goe to him this day? it is neither new moone, nor Sabboth day.</hi> Pſal. 84.7. <hi>They goe from ſtrength to ſtrength, till euery one appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such alſo are the workes of mercy, whereby the ſafetie of life or good is procured: as that which Paul did. Act. 20.9. <hi>As Paul was long preaching, Eutichus ouercome with ſleepe, fell downe from the third loft, and was taken vp dead: But Paule went downe and layd himſelfe vpon him, and embraced him, ſaying, Trouble not your ſelues, for his life is in him.</hi> v. 12. <hi>And they brought the boy aliue, and they were not a litle comforted.</hi> 2. To help a beaſt out of a pit. Luk. 14.5. <hi>Which of you ſhall haue an oxe, or an aſſe fallen into a pit, and will not ſtraight way pull him out on the
<pb facs="tcp:5274:65"/>
Sabboth day?</hi> 3. Prouiſion of meate and drinke, Matth. 12.1. <hi>Ieſus went through the corne on a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day, and his diſciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the eares of corne and to eate.</hi> In prouiſion, we muſt take heede that our cookes, and houſhold ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants breake not the Sabboth.

If Dauid would not haue his ſeruants aduenture their corporall liues for his prouiſion, nor drinke the water whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had prouided it: much leſſe ought we, for our meates, to aduenture the ſoules of our ſeruants. 4.

            <p>God ſanctified the Sabboth when he did conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate it to his ſeruice; men ſanctifie it, when they worſhip God in it. In this place we are to conſider the Sabboth, how farre foorth it is ceremoniall, and how farre foorth morall.</p>
            <p>The Sabboth is ceremoniall, in reſpect of the ſtrict obſeruation thereof, which was a type of the internal ſanctification of the people of God, &amp; that is, as it were, a continuall reſting from the worke of ſinne. Exod. 31.13. <hi>Speake thou alſo vnto the children of Iſrael, and ſay, Notwithſtanding keepe ye my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths: for it is a ſigne betweene me and you in your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that ye may know that I the Lord do ſanctifie you.</hi> The ſame is recorded, Ezech. 20.12.</p>
            <p>It ſignified alſo that bleſſed reſt of the faithfull, in the kingdome of heauen. Eſa. 66.23. <hi>From moneth to moneth, and from Sabboth to Sabboth ſhall all fleſh come to worſhip before me, ſayth the Lord.</hi> Heb. 4.8, 9, 10. <hi>If Ieſus had giuen them a reſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:66"/>The Sabboth is likewiſe ceremoniall, in that it was obſerued the ſeuenth day after the creation of the world, and was then ſolemnized with ſuch ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. Nom. 28.9. <hi>But on the Sabboth day, ye ſhal offer two lambes of a yeare old without ſpot, &amp; two tenth deales of fine floure for a meate offering, mingled with oyle, and the drinke offering thereof.</hi> ver. 10. <hi>This is the burnt offring of euery Sabboth, beſide the continuall burnt offering and drinke offering thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now in the light of the Goſpell, &amp; the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches profeſsing the ſame, the ceremony of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both is ceaſed. Coloſſ. 2.16. <hi>Let no man condemne you in meate and drinke, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moone, or of the Sabboth:</hi> ver. 17. <hi>which are but ſhadowes of things to come, but the bodie is Chriſt.</hi> The obſeruation of the Sabboth was tranſlated by the Apoſtles from the ſeuenth day, to the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Act. 20.7. <hi>The firſt day of the weeke, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples being come together to breake bread, Paul prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them.</hi> 1. Cor. 16.1.2. <hi>Concerning the gathering for the Saints, as I haue ordained in the churches of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, ſo do ye alſo, euery firſt day of the weeke, let euery one of you put aſide by himſelfe, and lay vp as God hath proſpered him, that then there be no gatherings when I come.</hi> This day, by reaſon that our Sauiour did vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it riſe againe, is called the Lords day. Reuel. 1.10. <hi>I was rauiſhed in the ſpirite on the Lords day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The obſeruation of the Sabboth thus conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apoſtles, was neuertheleſſe neglected of thoſe churches which ſucceeded them, but after was reuiued &amp; eſtabliſhed by Chriſtian Emperors,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:66"/>
as a day moſt apt to celebrate the memorie of the creation of the world, and to the ſerious meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the redemption of mankind. <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Anton. Edict.</hi> of holy dayes.</p>
            <p>The obſeruation of the Sabboth is morall, in as much as it preſerueth the miniſterie of the worde, and the ſolemne worſhip of God, eſpecially in the aſſemblies of the Church. And in this reſpect we are vpon this day, as well enioyned a reſt from our vocations, as the Iewes were. Eſa. 58.13. <hi>Jf thou turne away thy foote from the Sabboth, from doing thy will on mine holy day, and call my Sabboth a delight, to conſecrate it, as glorious to the Lord, and ſhalt honour him, not doing thine owne waies, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, it is morall, in that it freeth ſeruants and cattell from their labours, which on other dayes do ſeruice vnto their owners.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The manner of louing, is ſo to loue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our ſelues, to wit, truly and ſyncerely: when as contrarily, the true manner of louing God, is to loue God without meaſure.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde table contayneth ſixe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: whereof the firſt, and, in the order of the ten commaundements, the fift, concerneth the preſeruation of the dignitie and excellencie of our neighbour.</p>
            <p>The wordes are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother, that they may prolong thy dayes in the land, which the Lord thy God giueth thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honour.</hi> This word, by the figure, ſignifieth all that duetie, whereby our neighbours dignitie is preſerued, but eſpecially our ſuperiours. This dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie proceedeth of this, that euery man beareth in him ſome part of the image of God, if we reſpect the outwarde order and decencie, which is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the church and common wealth. In the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, there is a certaine image of the power and glorie of God. Dan. 2.37. <hi>O king, thou art a king of kings: for the God of heauen hath giuen thee a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, and ſtrength, and glorie.</hi> Hence is it, that magiſtrats are called gods. Pſal. 82.1. In an old man, is the ſimilitude of the eternitie of God: in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the likeneſſe of his fatherhoode. Matth. 23.9. <hi>And call no man your father vpon the earth: for there is but one, your Father which is in heauen.</hi> In a man, is the image of Gods prouidence and authoritie: for a
<pb facs="tcp:5274:69"/>
man ought not to couer his head, becauſe he is the image of the glorie of God: but the woman is the glorie of her husbande. Finally, in a learned man, is the likeneſſe of the knowledge and wiſedome of God. Now therefore, that perſon, in whom euen the leaſt title of the image of God appeareth, is to be honoured and reuerenced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thy father.</hi> By a figure we muſt here vnderſtand, all thoſe that are our ſuperiours: as parents, magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, miniſters, our Elders, and thoſe that do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell vs to any giftes whatſoeuer. The Kings of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rar were called Abimelech. Gen. 20.2. Gen. 45.8. <hi>God hath made me a father vnto Pharaoh, and Lorde ouer all his houſe.</hi> 1.

            <p>
               <hi>That they may prolong.</hi> Parents are ſaide to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the liues of their Children, becauſe they are Gods inſtruements, whereby their childrens liues are prolonged: for oftentimes the name of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is attributed to the inſtruement, wherewith the action is wrought. Luk. 16.9. <hi>Make you freendes with the riches of iniquitie, that when ye ſhall want, they may receiue you into euerlaſting habitations.</hi> 1. Tim. 4.16. <hi>For in doing ſo, thou ſhalt both ſaue thy ſelf, and them that heare me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But parents doo prolong the liues of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in commaunding them to walke in the waies of the Lord, by exerciſing iuſtice and Iudgement. Gene. 18.19. For being become godlye, they haue the promiſe both of this life, and the life to come. 1. Tim. 4.8.</p>
            <p>Further, they effect the ſame thing by their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made in the behalfe of their children. Hereby it plainely appeareth, that the vſuall cuſtome of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſaluting their parents, to aske their bleſsing, is no light or vaine thing.</p>

vs to the obedience of this commaundement, is drawen from the ende: which reaſon is alſo a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, yet a ſpeciall promiſe. Epheſians 6.2. <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the firſte commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement with promiſe,</hi> (I ſay, <hi>ſpeciall</hi>) becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the ſecond Commaundement is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and belongeth to all the reſt of the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
            <p>And God promiſeth long life not abſolutely, but ſo far as it is a bleſsing. Ephe. 6.3. <hi>That it may be well with thee, and that thou maiſt liue long on earth:</hi> for we muſt thinke that long life is not alwaies a bleſsing, but that ſomtime it is better to die the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue. Iſay. 57.1. <hi>The righteous periſheth, and no man conſidereth it in hart: and mercifull men are taken away, and no man vnderſtandeth that the righteous is taken away from the euil to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if at any time the Lord giueth a ſhort life to obedient children, he rewardeth them againe with eternall life in heauen, and ſo the promiſe faileth not, but changeth for the better.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly, towards thoſe that are our ſuperiours in authoritie: and firſte, obedience to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements. Rom. 13.1.</hi> Let euery ſoule be ſubiect to the higher powers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are to be admoniſhed to obedience, becauſe euery higher power is the ordinance of God, and the obedience which we performe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth it as though it were done to himſelfe and to Chriſt. Rom. 13.2.</hi> Whoſoeuer therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receiue to themſelues iudgement. <hi>Coloſſ. 3.23.</hi> And whatſoeuer ye doo, doo it hartilye, as vnto the Lord, and not vnto men. <hi>ver, 24.</hi> Knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall receiue the reward of the inheritance: for ye ſerue the Lord Chriſt. <hi>Obedience is to be perfourmed to our ſuperiours with diligence and faithfulnes. Gen. 24.2.</hi> Abraham ſaide vnto his eldeſt ſeruant of his houſe,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:71"/>
which had the rule ouer all that he had: put now thy hand vnder my thigh, and I will make thee ſweare by the Lord God of heauen, and God of the earth, that thou ſhalt not take a wiſe vnto my ſonne of the daughters of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites, amongſt whom I dwell. <hi>10.</hi> So the ſeruant tooke ten Camels of his maſter, and departed. <hi>12.</hi> And he ſaid, O Lord God of my maiſter Abraham, I beſeech thee, ſend me good ſpeed this day, and ſhew mercy vnto my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Abraham. <hi>33.</hi> Afterward the meate was ſet before him, but he ſaid, I will not eate vntill I haue ſaid my meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: and Laban ſaid, ſpeak on. <hi>56.</hi> But he ſaid, hinder me not, ſeeing the Lord hath proſpered my iourney: ſend me away that I may goe to my maiſter. <hi>Gene. 31.38.</hi> This twenty yeeres haue I bene with thee, thine ewes and thy goates haue not caſt their young, and the rammes of thy flock haue I not eaten. <hi>39.</hi> Whatſoeuer was torn of beaſts, I brought it not vnto thee, but made it good my ſelf: of mine hand diddeſt thou require it, were it ſtolen by day, or ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len by night. <hi>40.</hi> J was in the day conſumed with heate, and with froſt in the night, ond my ſleepe departed from mine eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Furthermore, we muſt yeeld obedience to our ſuperiours: yea, although they be cruell and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but not in wickednes. 1. Pet. 2.18.</hi> Seruants, be ſubiect to your maſters with all feare, not only to the good and curteous, but alſo to the frowarde. <hi>Actes 4.19.</hi> Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to obey you rather then God, iudge ye.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. Subiection in ſuffering the puniſhments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by our ſuperiours. Gen. 16.6.</hi> Then Abraham ſaid to Sarai. Beholde, thy mayd is in thine hand, do with
<pb facs="tcp:5274:72"/>
her as it pleaſeth thee: then Sarai dealt roughly with her: wherfore ſhe fledde from her. <hi>9.</hi> Then the Angell of the Lord ſaide vnto her, returne vnto thy dame, and humble thy ſelfe vnder her hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And although the puniſhment ſhould be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, yet muſt we ſuffer it, vntill we can get ſome lawfull remedy for the ſame. 1. Peter 2.19.</hi> For it is thanke worthie, if a man for conſcience toward God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure griefe, ſuffering wronfully. <hi>20.</hi> For what praiſe is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye take it patiently? but and if, when ye doo well, ye ſuffer wrong, and take it patiently, this is acceptable to God.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III. Thankfulnes in our praiers. 1. Timothie 2.1, 2.</hi> I exhorte ye therfore, that firſt of all, ſupplications, praiers, interceſsions, and giuing of thankes bee made for all men, for Kings, and for all that are in authoritye, that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life, in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes, and honeſty. <hi>1. Tim. 5.17. Elders that rule wel, are worthie of double honour. Geneſis 45.9.</hi> Haſte you, and goe vp to my father, and tell him, thus ſaith thy Sonne Ioſeph, God hath made me Lord ouer all Egipt, come downe to me, tarrie not, <hi>10.</hi> and then ſhnll dwell in the land of Goſhen. <hi>11.</hi> Alſo I will nouriſhe thee there, for yet remaine fiue yeres of famine, leaſt thou perriſh thr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ough pouertie, thou &amp; thy houſhold, and al that thou haſt.</p>

Pet. 3.11.</hi> Decline from euill, and do good, ſeeke peace, and follow after it. <hi>3. By courteous anſweres. Pro. 15.1.</hi> A ſoft anſwere putteth away wrath: but grieuous words ſtirre vp anger. <hi>1. Sam. 1.14.</hi> Eli ſaid vnto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy drunkennes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee. <hi>v. 15.</hi> Then Hannah anſwered, &amp; ſaid, Nay my lord, but I am a woman trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in ſpirit, I haue drunk neither wine nor ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g drink, but haue powred out my ſoule before the Lord. <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon v. 15.</hi> It may be, that he therefore departed for a ſeaſon, that thou ſhouldeſt receiue him for euer. <hi>4.

Pet. 4.8.</hi> Aboue all things haue feruent loue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, for loue couereth a multitude of ſins. <hi>Prou. 17.9.</hi> He that couereth tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but he that repeateth a matter, ſeperateth the Prince. <hi>6. By taking euery thing (if it be poſsible) in the beſt part. 1. Cor. 13.5.</hi> Loue thinketh none euill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This ſheweth the lawfulnes of truces, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, &amp; other agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts concerning peace, being made to auoyd iniuries, maintain ancient bounds, procure ſecuritie in traffique, poſſeſsions, &amp; iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, ſet penſions, commons for cattell, liberties of hunting, fiſhing or fouling, and getting fewell, or other neceſſaries, for publique commodities, if there be no vnlawful conditions annexed vnto the ſame. And we may make this couenant not onely
<pb facs="tcp:5274:82"/>
with Chriſtians, but for the maintenance of peace, with infidels alſo. For that which is godly to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, is no leſſe godly to be promiſed. But it is a note of true godlineſſe, to be as much as may be, at peace with all men. Therefore to promiſe peace by couenant is very godly. We may ſee the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of this in the liues of holy men. Gen. 21.22.</hi> At that ſame time Abimelech and Pichol his chiefe captaine, ſpake vnto Abraham, ſaying, God is with thee in all that thou doeſt. <hi>v. 23.</hi> Now therefore ſweare vnto me here by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my children, nor my childrens children,, &amp;c. <hi>ver. 24.</hi> Then Abraham ſayd, I will ſweare. <hi>v. 27.</hi> Then Abraham took ſheep &amp; beeues, and gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Abimeclech: and they two made a couenant. <hi>Gen. 31.44.</hi> Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come and let vs make a couenant, J and thou, which may be a witneſſe betweene me and thee. <hi>ver. 45.</hi> Then tooke Iaakob a ſtone, and ſet it vp as a pillar, &amp;c. <hi>v. 51.</hi> Laban ſayd to Iaakob, Behold this heape, and behold the pillar, which I haue ſet betweene me and thee. <hi>verſ. 53.</hi> The God of Abraham, and the gods of Nahor, and the God of their father be iudge betweene vs: But Iaakob ſware by the feare of his father Izhak.</p>

Matth. 25.41, 42.</hi> Depart from me ye curſed into euerlaſting fire which is prepared for the deuill and his angels. For I was an hungred and ye gaue me no meate, I thirſted and ye gaue me no drinke &amp;c. <hi>verſ. 45.</hi> In as much as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me.

                  <hi>When a man is dead, we ought to commit the dead corps to the graue, as may appeare by theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. 1. The inſtinct of Nature it ſelfe. 2.

The Lordes owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of buriall, in that he numbreth it amongſt his benefites. For the want thereof is a curſe.

<pb facs="tcp:5274:87"/>
as may appeare, in that it is the puniſhment of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

               <p n="7">7. With man and wife. They abuſe their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if they know eche other ſo long as the woman is in her flowers. Ezek. 22.10. <hi>In thee haue they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered their Fathers ſhame, in thee haue they vexed her that was polluted in her flowers.</hi> Leuit. 18.19. <hi>Thou ſhalt not goe vnto a woman to vncouer her ſhame, as long as ſhe is put aparte for her diſeaſe.</hi> Ezek. 8.6. <hi>If a man hath not lyen with a menſtrous woman.</hi> Againe, they finne if they liue together intemperately. Ambroſ. lib. de Philoſ. which Auguſtine citeth, lib. 2. contra Iulian, ſaith, that he committeth adulterye with his wife, who in the vſe of wedlock hath neither regarde of ſeemelynes nor honeſtye. Hierome in his 1. booke contra Iulianum, ſaith. A wiſe man ought to loue

Nothing (ſaith he) is more ſhameles, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make a ſtrumpet of his wife. 8. Nocturnall pollutions, which ariſe of immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diet, or vnchaſte cogitations, going before in the day. Deut 23.10. Onans ſinne Gen. 38.8. was not much vnlike theſe.</p>

Gal. 5.19. <hi>The works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are adulterie, fornication, vnclennes, wantonnes.</hi> Of this kinde are 1. Eyes ful of adultery. 2. Peter 2.14. <hi>Hauing eyes full of adulterye, and that cannot ceaſe to ſinne.</hi> 2. Idlenes. 2.

It is a note of great idlenes and ſlothfulnes. For commonly ſuch as beſtowe much time in tricking and trimming themſelues vp, doo quite neglect other buſines, and of all things cannot away with paines. 4. It argueth leuitie, in deuiſing euerye daye ſome newe faſhion, or imitating that, which others deuiſe. 5.

Fulnes of Bread and meate, which prouoke luſt. Exechi. 16.45. <hi>This was the iniquitie of thy ſiſter Sodom, pride, fulnes of broad, and idlenes was in her, &amp; in her daughters.</hi> Luk. 16.19. <hi>Ther was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linnen, and

Corrupt, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and vnſeemelye talke. 1. Corinth. 15.33. <hi>Erre not, euill talke corrupteth good manners.</hi> Such are vaine loue ſongs, ballads, enterludes, &amp; amorous books. This is the thing we are carefullye to ſhunne, in the reading of Poets, yet ſo, as mariners do in nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who forſake not the ſea, but decline, and flye from the rockes. 6. Laſciuious repreſentations of loue matters, in playes and comedies. Epheſ. 5.3, 4. <hi>Fornication, and all vncleannes, let it not once be named among you, as it becommeth Saints, neither filthines, nor fooliſh talking, neither ieſting, which are things not come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> 7.

Exod. 23.1.</hi> Thou ſhalt not receiue a falſe tale, neither ſhalt thou put thine hand with the wicked, to be a falſe witnes. <hi>1. Sa. 24.10.</hi> And Dauid ſaide to Saul, wherefore giueſt thou an eare to mens wordes, that ſay, Behold, Dauid ſpeaketh euill againſt thee?</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>VI. To accuſe our neighbour, for that which is certaine and true, through hatred and with intent to hurt him. 1. Samuel. 22.9.</hi> Then anſwered Doeg the Edomite (who was appointed ouer the ſeruants of Saul) and ſaid, I ſaw the Sonne of Jſhai when he came to Nob. to Abimilech the Sonne of Ahitub. <hi>verſe 10.</hi> Who asked counſell of the Lord for him, and gaue him vitailes, and he gaue him alſo the Swoorde of Goliath the Philiſtim. <hi>Of this deed Dauid thus ſpeaketh.

            <p>THe tenth commaundement, concerneth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences, committed againſt our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The words are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet thy neighbours houſe, thou ſhalt not couet thy neighbours wife, nor his ſeruant, nor his maid, nor his oxe, nor his aſſe, nor any thing thy neighbor hath.</hi>

                  <hi>Couet.</hi> The cogitation or motion of the hart, is of three ſorts. The firſt is, ſome glauncing or ſodaine thought, ſuggeſted to the minde by Satan, which ſodainly vaniſheth away, and is not receiued of the minde. This is no ſinne. For it was in Chriſt, when he was tempted by the deuill. Matth. 1.4. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, a more parmenent thought or motion, the which, as it were, tickleth and inueigleth the minde with ſome inward ioy. The third is, a cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation drawing from the will and affection, full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſinne. We are to vnderſtand this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the ſecond ſort of motions onely, not of the firſte, or of the laſt, to which the fiue former commandements doe belong.</p>
               <p>Now then to couet, is to think inwardly, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to deſire any thing, wherby our neighbour may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:5274:107"/>
diſalow a purpoſe onely to doo euil, if it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with a manifeſt deliberation. As for the concupiſcence in this place forbidden, we may wel think it is more cloſe and ſecret becauſe St. Paul a Doctor of the law, was a togither ignorant of it. Rom. 7.7. <hi>J had not knowne luſt, except the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> Againe, if that concupiſcence immediatlye going before the conſent, were not prohibited in this place, there muſt be a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in the decalogue. For the ſeauenth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement forbiddeth ſome kinde of coueting of our neighbours wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Houſe.</hi> The commandement is illuſtrated by an argument drawen from the diſtribution of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of concupiſcence; whence it is apparant, that onelye euill concupiſcence is condemned in this place. Col. 3.5. For there is a good concupiſcence or deſire: as of meat, and drinke, and that of the ſpirit. Gal 5.17. <hi>The ſpirite luſteth againſt the fleſh.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:5274:108"/>
               <hi>The firſt is, to lay open ſinne, and make it known. Rom. 3.20.</hi> By the workes of the Law ſhall no fleſh be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in his ſight: for by the Lawe commeth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſinne.</p>

               <hi>The ſecond vſe is accidentarily, to effect and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſinne, by reaſon of the fleſh, the which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth man to decline from that which is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and euer to encline to that which is prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Rom. 7.8.</hi> Sinne tooke occaſion by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wrought in me all maner of concupiſcence: for without the Law ſinne is dead. <hi>verſe 9.</hi> For I once was aliue without the Lawe: but when the commaundement came, ſinne reuiued. <hi>v. 10,</hi> But I died, and that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, which was ordeined vnto life, was found to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me vnto death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third vſe is, to denounce eternal damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the leaſt obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, without offeri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g any hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. This ſentence the law pronounceth againſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, &amp; by it, partly by threatning, partly by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying, it reigneth and ruleth ouer man. Rom. 3.19.</hi> We know that whatſoeuer the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them which are vnder the law, that euery mouth may be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and all the worlde be culpable before God. <hi>Gal. 3.10.</hi> As many as are of the workes of the Lawe, are vnder the curſe: for it is writter.

               <hi>The countenance of this power of the lawe is perpetuall, vnleſſe a ſinner repent: and the very firſt act of repentance ſo freeth him, that he ſhall no more be vnder the law, but vnder grace. 2.

            <p>
               <hi>If therfore thou deſireſt ſeriouſlye eternall life: firſt take a narrow examination of thy ſelfe, and the courſe of thy life, by the ſquare of Gods Law: then ſet before thine eyes the curſe that is due vnto ſin, that, thus bewailing thy miſerie, and diſpairing vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlye of thine owne power, to attaine euerlaſting happines, thou maiſt renounce thy ſelf, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to ſeeke, and ſue vnto Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>

            <p>HItherto concerning the couenont of workes. and of the Law, who followeth the couenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>The couenant of Grace is that whereby God freely promiſing Chriſt, and his benefites, exacteth again of man, that he would by faith receiue chriſt, and repent him of his ſinnes. Hoſe. 2.18. <hi>In that day will I make a couenant for them, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 19. <hi>And J will marry thee to me for euer: yea, I will marrie thee vnto me in righteouſnes and iudgement, and in mercy, and in compaſsion.</hi> ver. 20. <hi>I will euen marrie thee vnto me in faithfulnes, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi> Ezech. 36.25. <hi>I will poure clean water vpon you, and ye ſhalbe clean: yea from all your filthines, and from all your idoles will I clenſe you.</hi> ver. 26. <hi>And J will giue you a new hart, and a new ſpirit wil I put within you.</hi> ver. 27. <hi>And cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes.</hi> Mal. 3.1. <hi>The Lord whom ye ſeeke ſhall ſpeedily come to his temple, euen the meſſenger of the couenant whom ye deſire: behold, he ſhall come, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This couenant, is alſo named a teſtament: for it hath partly the nature &amp; properties of a teſtament or will. Firſt, it is confirmed by the teſtator. Heb. 9.16. <hi>When a Taſtament is, there muſt be the death of him that made the teſtament.</hi> v. 17. <hi>For the teſtament is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed when men are dead: for it is yet of no force, ſo long as he that made it is aliue.</hi> Secondly, in this couenant, we do not offer much, and promiſe ſmall to God,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:110"/>
but in a maner do only receiue: euen as the laſt wil and teſtament of a man, is not for the teſtators, but the heires commoditie.</p>
            <p>The couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t albeit it be one in ſubſtance, yet it is diſtinguiſhed into the old and new Teſtament.</p>
            <p>The old Teſtament or couenant, is that, which in tipes and ſhadowes prefigured Chriſt to come, and to be exhibited.</p>
            <p>The new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t declareth chriſt alredy come in the fleſh, and is apparantly ſhewed in the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>The Goſpell is that part of Gods worde, which conteineth a moſt worthie and welcome meſſage: namelye, that mankinde is fullye redeemed by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, the onely begotten Sonne of God, manifeſt in the fleſh: ſo that now, for all ſuch as repent, and beleue in Chriſt Ieſus, there is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a full remiſsion of all their ſinnes, together with ſaluation and life euerlaſting. Iohn. 3.14. <hi>As Moſes lifted vp the ſerpent in the wildernes, ſo muſt the ſonne of man be lift vp.</hi> v. 15. <hi>That who ſo beleeueth in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> Act. 10.43. <hi>To him alſo giue al the prophets witnes, that through his name, al that beleue in him ſhall receiue remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The end and vſe of the Goſpell is. 1. To manifeſt that righteouſnes in Chriſt, wherby the whole law is fully ſatisfied, and ſaluation attained. 2. It is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and as it were the conduit pipe of the holy ghoſt, to faſhion and deriue faith into the ſoule; by which faith they which beleeue, do as with an hand apprehend Chriſtes righteouſnes.

            </p>
            <p>The goſpel preached, is in the flouriſhing eſtate of Chriſts church, that ordinarie means to beget faith: but in the rumous eſtate of the ſame, when as by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacie, the foundations therof are ſhaken, and the clear light of the word is darkned, then this worde read or repeated, yea, the very ſound thereof being but once heard, is by the aſsiſtance of Gods ſpirite, extraordinarily effectuall, to them whom God wil haue called out of that great darknes into his excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding light.

            <p>THus much of the preaching of the word: now follow the appendants to the ſame: namelye, the Sacraments</p>
            <p>A ſacrament is that, wherby Chriſt and his ſauing graces, are by certaine externall rites, ſignified, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and ſealed to a Chriſtian man.

                  </gap> and you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:111"/>We muſt not therefore ſurmiſe that there is any inherent force or efficacie of ſanctifying, in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and externall ſigne of the ſacrament, as the bath waters haue to cure diſeaſes: for the power of ſanctification, is appropriate onely to the holie Ghoſt: and Chriſt hath ordeyned the ſigne to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie grace, not to conferre it.</p>
            <p>In euery Sacrament we muſt obſerue the partes, and the mutuall relation that partes haue one to another.</p>
            <p>The partes of a Sacrament are, eyther the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſignes, or the thing ſignified, that is, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The externall ſigne is, either ſome preſcript and ſenſible matter, or the externall action in the vſe of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The thinges ſignified in the Sacrament, are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt and his benefites, or the internal action that is about Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The internall action, is the action either of God, or of faith.</p>
            <p>The action of God is his offering, applying, and ſealing vp of Chriſt and his benefites in the heartes of the faithfull.</p>
            <p>The action of faith is the conſideration, deſire, apprehenſion, and receiuing of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The mutuall relation of the partes of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is an agreeable vnion and reſpect, of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall &amp; internall, both things with things, &amp; actions with actions, according to Gods holy inſtitutions
<pb facs="tcp:5274:112"/>
by which it is made a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becauſe the ſignes incurring into the externall ſenſes, doe by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine proportion mooue a Chriſtian minde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the things ſignified, and alſo to apply them vnto their holy end.</p>
            <p>This mutuall, and as I may ſay, ſacramentall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is the cauſe of ſo many figuratiue ſpeeches, and metonymies, which are vſed: as, when one thing in the ſacrament is put for an other. As,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The ſigne is vſed for the thing ſignified. Exo. 12.11. <hi>Ye ſhall eate it (namely the Lambe) in haſte, for it is the Lordes paſſeouer.</hi> Ioh. 6.51. <hi>I am that liuing bread which came downe from heauen: If any eate of this bread, he ſhall liue for euer, and the bread which I will giue is my fleſh, which I will giue for the life of the world.</hi> 1. Cor. 5.7. <hi>Chriſt our Paſſeouer is ſacrificed for vs.</hi> 1. Cor. 10.17. <hi>We that are many, are one bread, and one bodie, becauſe we are all partakers of one bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The name of the thing ſignified is giuen to the ſigne: as, <hi>The bread is Chriſts bodie, the cuppe is Chriſts bloud.</hi> 1. Cor. 11.24. Mat. 26.28.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The effect of the thing ſignified is giuen to the ſigne as circumciſion is a couenant. Gen. 17.10. Act. 7.8. <hi>The cup is the new teſtament in Chriſts bloud.</hi> Luk. 22.16. <hi>Baptiſme is the waſhing of the new birth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IIII. That which properlye belongeth to the ſigne, is attributed to the thing ſignified. Deut. 10.16. <hi>Circumciſe the fore skin of your harts.</hi> Ioh. 6.35. <hi>Vnleſſe ye eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, ye ſhall haue no life in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:112"/>Hence it appeareth that there is ſmall or no cauſe why the Papiſts ſhould ſo vrge tranſubſtantiation, and the Lutherans conſubſtantiation as they doe.</p>

               <hi>Chap. 33.</hi> Of Baptiſme.</head>
            <p>THere are two Sacraments. 1. Cor. 10.1. <hi>I would not haue you ignorant, that all our Fathers were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cloude, and all paſſed through the ſea.</hi> verſe 2. <hi>And were all baptized vnto Moſes in the cloude, and in the ſea.</hi> v. 3. <hi>And did all eat the ſame ſpirituall meat.</hi> ver. 4. <hi>and dranke all the ſame ſpirituall drinke: (for they dranke of the ſpirituall Rocke that followed them, which Rocke was Christ.)</hi> Tertull. 4. booke contra Marcion. Auguſt. de Symbol. ad Catechum. 4. book 6. Chap.</p>
            <p>The firſt Sacrament is that, whereby Chriſtians are imitiated, and admitted to the Church of God: and this is Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Sacrament, whereby the Church is preſerued and nouriſhed, is the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>Baptiſme is a Sacrament, by which ſuch as are within the couenant are waſhed with water, in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſte: that being thus engraffed into Chriſt, they may haue perpetual felowſhip with him. Mat. 28.19. <hi>Go teach all nations, baptizing them in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Father, the Sonne, and the holye Ghoſt.</hi> Matth. 16.16. <hi>He that beleeueth, and is baptized, ſhalbe ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb facs="tcp:5274:113"/>
he that beleeueth not, ſhalbe condemned.</hi> 1. Corinth. 1.13. <hi>Is Christ deuided? was Paul crucified for you? ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were ye baptized into the name of Paul.</hi> verſe 14. <hi>I thanke God I baptized none of you but Chrispus, and Gaias.</hi> verſe 15. <hi>Leaſt any ſhould ſay, I had baptized into mine owne name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within the couenant are all the ſeede of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, or the ſeede of the faithfull. Theſe are eyther of ryper yeares, or Infantes.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of riper yeares, are all ſuch as adioyning themſelues to the viſible Church, doe both teſtifie their repentance of their ſinnes, and hold the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of religion, taught in the ſame Church. Matth. 3.6. <hi>And they were baptized of him in Iorden, confeſſing their ſinnes.</hi> Act. 8.36. <hi>As they went they came to a water: then the Eunuch ſaide, See, here is water, what hindereth me to be baptized?</hi> verſe 37. <hi>Then Philip ſaide, If thou beleeue with all thine heart, thou maieſt: he ſaide, I beleeue that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſonne of God.</hi> verſe 38. <hi>And they went downe into the water, both Philip &amp; the Eunuch, and he baptized him.</hi> Exod. 12.48. <hi>If a ſtranger dwell with thee, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the paſſeouer of the Lord, let him circumciſe all the males that belong vnto him, and then let him come and obſerue it, and then he ſhalbe as one that is borne in the lande: for none vncircumciſed perſon, ſhall eate thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Infantes within the couenant, are ſuch, as haue one at the leaſt of their parents faithfull. 1. Cor. 7.14. <hi>The vnbeleeuing husband is ſanctified by the wife, and the vnbeleeuing wife is ſanctified by the husbande,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:113"/>
elſe were your children vncleane, but now they are holy.</hi> Rom. 11.16. <hi>If the firſt fruites be holy, ſo is the whole lump<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: and if the roote be holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> Gen. 17.7. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my couenant betweene me &amp; thee, and thy ſeede after thee, in their generations, for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting couenant, to be God vnto thee, and thy ſeede after thee.</hi> verſe 13. <hi>Hee that is borne in thine houſe, and he that is bought with money, muſt needes be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed: ſo my couenant ſhalbe in your fleſh, for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting couenant.</hi> Act. 16.31. <hi>They ſaid, Beleeue in the Lord Ieſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaued and thy whole houſholde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be baptized into the Name of the father, &amp;c. after the receit of the outward ſigne of waſhing, is to be made one of Gods familie, which is his Church, and to be partaker of the priuiledges ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Gen. 48.16. <hi>The Angell which hath deliuered me from all euill, bleſſe the children, and let my name be named vpon them, and the name of my fathers, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and Izhak, that they may growe as fiſh into mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, in the middes of the earth.</hi> Eſay. 4.1. <hi>In that day ſhall ſeuen women take holde of one man, ſaying, We wil eate our owne bread, and we will weare our owne gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: onely let vs be called by thy name, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our reproch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this it is manifeſt, that in this waſhing of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, there is ſealed and propounded a maruellous ſolemne couenant and contract: firſt of God with the baptized, in that God the Father vouchſafed to receiue him into fauour, the Sonne to redeeme him, the holy Ghoſt to purifie and regenerate him:
<pb facs="tcp:5274:114"/>
ſecondly of the baptiſed with God, who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to acknowledge, inuocate, and worſhip none other God, but the true Iehouah, which is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>The externall and viſible matter of baptiſme is water: for the miniſter may not baptize with anie other liquor, but onely with naturall water.</p>
            <p>This was the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Primitiue Church. For when as a <hi>certaine miniſter, for want of water, tooke ſande, and baptized one with that, the partie thus beſanded, was further baptized, the former being eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of none effect.</hi> Niceph. hiſt. 3. booke. 33. chap.</p>
            <p>The externall forme of baptiſme, is the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters waſhing of the baptized, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript rule of Gods word. Rom. 10.14.</p>
            <p>The ancient cuſtome of baptizing, was to dip, and as it were, to diue, all the body of the baptized in the water, as may appeare in Paul, Rom. 6. and the Councils of Laodicea, &amp; Neocaeſarea: but now eſpecially in cold countries, the Church vſeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſprinckle the baptized, by reaſon of childrens weakeneſſe: for very few of ripe yeares, are now adaies baptized. We neede not much to marueile at this alteration, ſeeing charitie and neceſsitie may diſpenſe with ceremonies, and mitigate in equitie the ſharpeneſſe of them.</p>

            <p>Therefore they that are baptized of a miniſter, which is an heretike, not yet diſgraded from that calling, (if the externall forme of adminiſtration be obſerued) muſt not be baptized againe of the Church of God: eſpecially, if after baptiſme they haue beene made partakers of the Lordes Supper: onely they ought to be inſtructed in the true faith.

            <p>Againe, if through infirmitie, thou falleſt once or often into ſome ſinne, ſtill haue recourſe vnto Baptiſme, that there thou maieſt againe receiue courage to thy ſoule.

            <p>
               <hi>There are for the bruſing of this ſtonye harte, foure principal hammers. 1. The knowledge of the law of God. 2. The knowledge of ſin, both original, and actual, and what puniſhment is due vnto them. 3. Corruption, or pricking of the hart, namelye, a ſence and feeling of the wrath of God for the ſame ſinnes. 4. An holy deſperation of a mans own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in the obtaining of eternall life. Acts 2.37.</hi> When they heard theſe thinges, they were pricked in hart, and

            <p>
               <hi>The third, is faith, which is a miraculous and ſupernaturall facultie of the hart, apprehending Chriſt Ieſus, being applyed by the opperation of the holy Ghoſt, and receiuing him to it ſelf. Ioh. 1.12.6.35.</hi> Jeſus ſaide vnto them, I am the bread of life, he that commeth vnto me ſhall neuer hunger, and he that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in me, ſhall neuer thirſt. <hi>Rom. 9.30.</hi> What ſhall we ſay then? The Gentiles which followed not righteouſnes, haue attained vnto righteouſnes, euen the righteouſnes which is of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt is receiued when euery ſeuerall parſon doth particularly apply vnto himſelfe, Chriſt with his merites, by an inward perſwaſion of the hart, which commeth none other way, but by the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall certificate by the holy Ghoſt, concerning the mercye of God in Chriſt Ieſus. 1. Corinth. 2.12.</hi> We haue receiued not the ſpirite of the world but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is of God, that we might know the thinges that are giuen to vs of God. <hi>Ezech. 12.10.</hi> I will powre the

            <p>
               <hi>In the work of faith, there are 4. degrees, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart, linked and vnited together and are worthie the conſideration of euery Chriſtian.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The firſt, is knowledge of the Goſpell, by the illumination of Gods ſpirite.

            <p>
               <hi>To this, in ſuch as are truely humbled, is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſerious meditation of the promiſes in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſtirred vp by the ſencible feeling of their owne beggerie.</hi>

               <hi>This approching hath two partes.

            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond, is the crauing pardon of ſome ſins, with vnſpeakable ſighes, and in perſeuerance. Luk. 15.21. Act. 8.22.</hi> Repent of this wickednes, &amp; pray God, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>The fift ariſing of the former, is an eſpeciall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion imprinted in the hart by the holye Ghoſt, wherby euery faithfull man doth particularlye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply vnto himſelfe, thoſe promiſes which are made in the Goſpel. Mat. 9.2.</hi> They brought vnto him a man ſick of the palſie: and when Jeſus ſaw their faith, he ſaide vnto the ſicke of the palſie, Sonne, be of good comfort, thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee. <hi>Mat. 15.28.</hi> O woman, great is thy faith, be is vnto thee, as thou deſireſt.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>THe ſecond degree, is Iuſtification, whereby ſuch as beleue are accounted iuſt before God, through the obedience of Chriſt Ieſus. 2. Cor. 5.21.</hi> He hath made him to be ſinne for vs, which knew no ſin: that we ſhould be made the righteouſnes of God in him. <hi>1. Cor. 1.30.

            <p>
               <hi>Iuſtification hath two parres: Remiſsion of ſins, and Imputation of Chriſts righteouſnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remiſsion of ſins, is that parte of iuſtification, wherby he that beleeueth, is freede from the</hi> guilte <hi>and</hi> puniſhment <hi>of ſinne, by the merites of the paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt. Col. 1.21, 22.</hi> You hath he now reconciled in the body of his fleſh through death, to make you holye, and vnblameable, and without fault in his ſight. <hi>1.

               <hi>Chap. 38.</hi> Concerning the third degree of the declaration of Gods loue.</head>
            <p>THe third degree is Sanctification, wherby ſuch as beleeue, being deliuered from the tirannye of ſinne, are by little and little renued in holineſſe, and righteouſnes. 1. Ioh. 3.9. <hi>Whoſoeuer is born of God, ſinneth not: for his ſeede remaineth in him, neither can he ſinne, becauſe he is borne of God.</hi> Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to thoſe which are in Chriſt Jeſus, which walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sanctification hath two paates: Mortification, and Viuification.</p>
            <p>The mortification of ſinne is the firſte parte of ſanctification, whereby the power of ſin is abated, &amp; crucified in the faithful. Ro. 6.2. <hi>How ſhal we that are dead to ſin, liue yet therein?</hi> 3. <hi>Know ye not that all we which haue beene baptized into Jeſus Chriſt; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5274:126"/>
bene baptized into his death?</hi> 4. <hi>We are buried then with him by baptiſm into his death, that like as Chriſt was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp from the dead, by the glory of the Father, ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newnes of life.</hi> Eccl. 5.6, 7, 11, 12, 13. Gal, 5.24. <hi>They which are Chriſts haue crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſtes thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The means that work mortification, is the death and buriall of Chriſt, from whence proceedeth ſuch a vertue, as doth both keep vnder the ſtrength that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not break out as it would, and in man as it were in a graue, doth cauſe it to dye &amp; not putrifie. Rom. 6.6. <hi>Our olde man is crucified with him, that the body of ſinne might be deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Viuification is the ſecond parte of ſanctification: wherby inherent holynes being begun, is ſtill aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and enlarged. Firſt, we receiue the firſte fruites of the ſpirit, then a continual encreaſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ephe. 4.23. <hi>Be renued in the ſpirit of your minde.</hi> v. 24. <hi>And put on the new man which after God is created in righteouſnes, and true holynes.</hi> Eph. 2.1. <hi>And you that he quickned, that were dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes.</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>Thus J liue, yet not I now, but Chriſt in me: and in that I now liue by the fleſh, I liue by the faith of the ſonne of God, who hath loued me, and giuen himſelfe for me.</hi> Rom. 8.23. <hi>We which haue the firſt fruites of the ſpirite, euen we doo ſigh in our ſelues, waiting for the adoption, euen the redemption of our bodies.</hi> 1. Cor. 15.45. <hi>The firſt man Adam was made a liuing ſoule, and the ſecond man Adam was made a quickned ſpirite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The efficient cauſe of viuification is the holye Ghoſt, who doth by his diuine power conuey him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:5274:126"/>
into the beleeuers harts, and in them createth holines. Iob. 33.24, 25. <hi>Then will he haue mercy vpon him, and will ſay, deliuer him, that he goe not downe into the pit: for I haue receiued a reconciliation. Then ſhal his fleſh be as freſh as a childes, and ſhal return as in the daies of his youth.</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>Now ye are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, becauſe the ſpirit of God dwelleth in you: but if any man haue not the ſpirite of Chriſt, the ſame is not his.</hi> ver. 11. <hi>But if the ſpirit of him that raiſed vp Ieſus from the dead dwell in you, be that raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodies, becauſe that his ſpirite dwelleth in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preſeruatiue of viuificaton, is a vertue deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from Chriſtes reſurrection, to thoſe that are quickned, which maketh them to riſe vp to newnes of life. Phil. 3.10. <hi>That J may know him, and the vertue of his reſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, this inherent holines is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed into parts, according to the ſeuerall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the bodie and ſoule of man. Theſſa. 5.23. <hi>The very God of peace ſanctifie you throughout: And I pray God, that your whole ſpirit, ſoule, and bodye may be kept blameles, vntil the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <hi>Spirituall wiſedome, is alſo an illumination of the minde, whereby the ſame trueth, is applied to the good ordering of particular both things &amp; actions, as perſons, place, and times require.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe two, haue theſe effects which follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. To diſcerne betweene good and euill.

               <pb facs="tcp:5274:127"/>
               <hi>II. The ſanctitie of the memorie, is an abilitie to keepe a good thing, when it is offered to the minde, and as neede ſerueth, to remember it. Pſal. 119.11.</hi> I haue hid thy promiſe in mine heart, that I might not ſinne againſt thee. <hi>Pſal. 16.7.</hi> I will prayſe the Lord who hath giuen me counſell: my reynes alſo teach me in the nights. <hi>Luk. 2.51.</hi> His mother kept all theſe thinges in her heart.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III. The ſanctitie of conſcience, which is a grace of God, wherby a mans conſcience excuſeth him for all his ſinnes, after they are forgiuen him in Chriſt, as alſo of his vpright walking in the whole courſe of his life. 1. Tim. 1.19.</hi> Hauing faith and a good conſcience, which ſome hauing put away, &amp;c. <hi>1.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repentance is, when a ſinner turneth vnto the Lord. Act. 26.20.</hi> He ſhewed firſt vnto them of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, and at Ieruſalem, and through all the coaſtes of Iudea, and then to the Gentiles, that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turne to God, &amp; to doe workes worthy amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life. <hi>1.

Pſal. 119.112.</hi> I haue applyed my heart to fulfil thy ſtatutes alway, euen vnto the end. <hi>1. Iohn 3.3. Act. 11.23.</hi> Who when hee was come, and had ſeene the grace of God, was glad, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all, that with purpoſe of heart, they would cleane vnto the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fruite of repentance, is a Chriſtian conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, wherein are brought foorth fruites worthie amendment of life. Matth. 3.8.</hi> Bring ye therefore fruites worthy of repentance.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>The tempter, is the prince or his helpers. The prince is Satan and his angels, which are ſpirituall wickedneſſes, in hie things. His helpers are the fleſh and the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The conflict of all theſe, is temptation, wherby man is prouoked to commit ſuch wickedneſſe, as is hurtfull to the ſaluation of his ſoule. 1. Pet. 2.11.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſiſtance is an action, whereby the ſouldier doth withſtand temptation, through grace work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly in him. 1.

            <p n="5">
               <hi>V. That the mercy of God, and the merite of Chriſtes obedience, are infinite. Iſa. 54.10.</hi> For the mountaines ſhall remooue, and the hilles ſhall fall downe: but my mercie ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall my couenant of peace fall away, ſaith the Lorde, that hath compaſſion on thee. <hi>Pſalm. 103.11.</hi> For as high as the heauen is aboue the earth, ſo great is his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them that feare him. <hi>1.

            <p>
               <hi>THe third Aſſault is, concerning Sanctification. The temptation, is a prouoking to ſinne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the diſpoſition of euery man, and as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall offer it ſelfe. 1. Chron. 21.1.</hi> And Satan ſtoode vp againſt Iſrael, and prouoked Dauid to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Iſrael. <hi>Iohn 13.2.</hi> And when ſupper was done, the deuill had now put in the hart of Iudas Iſcariot, Simons ſonne, to betray him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this temptation, the deuill doth wonderfully diminiſh and make leſſe thoſe ſins, which men are about to commit, partly by obiecting the mercy of God, and partly by couering or hiding the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is due for the ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then, there are helpes to further the deuill in his temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, the fleſh which luſteth againſt the ſpirite, ſometimes by begetting euill motions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſometimes by ouerwhelming and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the good intents and motions. Gal. 15.17.</hi> For the fleſh luſteth against the ſpirite, &amp; the spirite againſt the fleſh: and theſe are contrarie one to another, ſo that ye can not doe the ſame things that ye would. <hi>verſe 19.</hi> Moreouer, the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are adulterie, fornication, vncleannes, wantonnes. <hi>ver. 20.</hi> Idolatrie, witchcraft, hatred, debate, emulations, wrath, contentions, ſeditions, hereſies, <hi>verſe 21.</hi> Enuie, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, drankenneſſe, gluttonie, and ſuch like, whereof I
<pb facs="tcp:5274:135"/>
tell you before, as I alſo haue tolde you before, that they which doo ſuch thinges, ſhall not inherite the kingdome of God. <hi>Iames. 1.14.</hi> But euerye man is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when he is drawne away by his own concupiſcence, and is entiſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, the worlde, which bringeth men to diſobedience, through pleaſure, profit, honour, and euill examples. Epheſ. 2.3.</hi> Among whome we alſo had our conuerſation in time paſt, in the luſtes of our fleſh, in fulfilling the will of the fleſh, and of the minde, and were by nature the children of wrath, as well as others. <hi>1. Iohn 2.16.</hi> For all that is in the world, as the luſtes of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the father, but is of the worlde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſiſtance is made by the deſire of the ſpirite, which woorketh good motions and affections in the faithfull, and driueth foorth the euill. Galla. 5.22.</hi> But the fruite of the ſpirite is loue, ioy, peace, long ſuffering, gentlenes, goodnes, faith. <hi>Verſe. 23.</hi> Meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, teemperancie: againſt ſuch there is no law. <hi>Ver. 24.</hi> For they that are Chriſts, haue crucified the fleſh, with the affections and the luſtes thereof. <hi>Verſ. 26.</hi> Let vs not be deſirous of vaine glory, prouoking one another, en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>In this temptation the fall is, when a man being preuented, falleth into ſome offence. Gal. 6.1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here Satan doth wonderfullye make greeuous the offence committed, and doth accuſe and terrifie the offender with the iudgements of God. Mat. 27 3.</hi> Then when Iudas which betraied him, ſaw that he was condemned, he repented himſelfe, and brought againe the thirtie peeces of ſiluer, to the cheefe preeſts and elders, <hi>v. 4,</hi> Saying, I haue ſinned, betraying the innocent blood: but they ſaide, What is that to vs? ſee thou to it. <hi>Verſ. 5.</hi> And when he had caſt down the ſiluer peeces in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:136"/>
he departed, and went and hanged himſelfe.</p>

               <hi>II. An holy Meditation, which is manifolde:
<pb facs="tcp:5274:137"/>
1. That the afflictions of the faithfull, come not by chaunce, but by the counſell and prouidence of God, which diſpoſeth all things in a moſt excellent ſort. Gen. 45.4, 5.</hi> It was God that ſent Joſeph into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. <hi>2. Sam. 16.10.</hi> The Lorde biddeth Shemei curſe Dauid. <hi>Pſal. 119.71.</hi> It was good for me, that I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, that J might learne thy ſtatutes. <hi>2. That albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it afflictions are grieuous, yet are they good and profitable. For they are helpes, whereby men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humble for their ſinnes before God, obtaine peace, and holineſſe of life. 2. Cor. 1.9.</hi> We receiued ſentence of death in our ſelues, becauſe we ſhould not truſt in our ſelues, but in God, which rayſed the dead. <hi>Iſa. 26.16.</hi> Lord, in trouble haue they viſited thee, they powred out a prayer, when thy chaſtening was vpon them. <hi>Hoſ. 5.15.</hi> J will go, and returne to my place, till they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their fault, and ſeeke me: in their affliction they will ſeeke me diligently. <hi>Pſal. 78.34.</hi> When we ſlue them, they ſought him, and they returned, and they ſought God earely. <hi>Ier. 31.18.</hi> J haue heard Ephraim lamenting thus, thou haſt corrected me, and J was chaſtiſed as an vntamed calfe: conuert thou me, and J ſhalbe conuerted. <hi>Hebr. 12.11.</hi> No chaſtiſement for the preſent ſeemeth ioyous, but grieuous: but afterwarde, it bringeth the quiet fruite of righteouſneſſe vnto them, which are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by exerciſed. <hi>Pſal. 30.5.</hi> Weeping may abide at euening, but ioy commeth in the morning. <hi>3. That God hath promiſed fauour, mittigation of puniſhments, his preſence, &amp; deliuerance. Phil. 1.29. 1. Cor. 10.13.</hi> God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue meaſure, but with tentation will giue deliuerance.
<pb facs="tcp:5274:138"/>

They ſhall inherit the kingdome of heauen, yea the new heauens, and new earth ſhalbe their inheritance. 1. Pet. 1.4.</hi> God hath begotten you to an inheritance immortall and vndefiled, and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away, reſerued in heauen for you. <hi>Mat. 25.34.</hi> Then ſhall the King ſay to them on his right hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, poſſeſſe a kingdome prepared for you, before the foundations of the worlde were laide. <hi>Reuel. 5.10.</hi> Thou hast made vs vnto our God, Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reigne on the earth. <hi>Reuel. 21.7.</hi> He that ouercommeth, ſhall inherite all things, and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my ſonn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>The fruite that commeth from both theſe parts of bleſſedneſſe, is of two ſorts: Eternall ioy, and the perfect ſeruice of God.

               <hi>The manner of perfourming this ſeruice, is to worſhip God by God himſelfe immediately.

               <hi>Chap. 51.</hi> Concerning the order of the cauſes of ſaluation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of the Church of Rome.</head>
            <p>THere are two things requiſite to obtaine ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Predeſtination, &amp; the Execution thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:146"/>Predeſtination is a fore-ordaining of the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature to grace in this life, and glorie in the life to come. Sebaſt. Catta. Enchirid. tract. 1. cap. vlt.</p>
            <p>This in regard of the firſt effects thereof, which are vocation, election, and ordination to eternall life, hath the cauſe of it in God, namely his will: but in regard of the laſt effect, which is, the execution of ſuch an ordinance, and the obtaining of eternall life, it hath the cauſe of it from man. But for the more euident declaration of this, theſe ſeauen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions muſt be ſet downe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Predeſtination, and Reprobation of God, doe not conſtraine or inforce any neceſsitie vpon the will of man.</p>
            <p n="2">II. God hath predeſtinated all men, that is, hee hath appointed and diſpoſed all men, ſo as they might obtaine eternall ſaluation.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Man is neither by neceſsitie nor chance ſaued or condemned, but voluntarily.</p>
            <p n="4">IIII. God hath Predeſtinated ſome, other hath he reiected.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Thoſe whom God hath predeſtinated by his abſolute predeſtination, which cannot be loſt, they ſhall infallibly die in grace: But they which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate by that predeſtination which being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t iuſtice, may be loſt by ſome mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne which followeth, are not infallibly ſaued, but oftentimes ſuch are condemned, &amp; looſe their crown &amp; glory. Hence ariſeth that poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theirs, that hee which is iuſtified may be a reprobate, and
<pb facs="tcp:5274:147"/>
periſh eternally. Torrenſis Aug. Confeſſ. 2. book. 4. chap. 20. ſect. Therefore predeſtination is not certaine, ſeeing it may be loſt.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. God alone doeth know the certaine and ſet number of them which are predeſtinate.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. There is one ſet number of them which are predeſtinate, or reprooued, and that can neither be encreaſed nor diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>The execution of Predeſtination, is either in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, or thoſe of yeeres of diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Concerning infants, the merite of Chriſt is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto them, by baptiſme rightly adminiſtred: ſo that whatſoeuer, in originall corruption, may truly and properly be accounted for ſinne, it is not only, as I may ſay, not pared away, or not imputed, but vtterly taken away. For there is nothing that God can hate in ſuch as are renued. Concil. Trid. 5. ſect. 5. can.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe they are vrged to confeſſe, that there remaineth yet in ſuch as are baptized concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, or the relikes of ſinne. The which ſeeing it is left in men for them to wreſtle withall, it hath not power to hurt ſuch as yeeld not vnto it.</p>
            <p>The execution of predeſtination in ſuch as are of riper yeeres, hath ſixe degrees.</p>
            <p>The firſt is vocation, whereby men, not for their owne merites, but by Gods preuenting grace through Chriſt, are called to turne vnto God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, a preparation to righteouſneſſe, whereby men, through the inherent power of free will, doe apply themſelues to ſanctification, after
<pb facs="tcp:5274:147"/>
that the ſame power is ſtirred vp by the holy Ghoſt. For free will is onely ſomewhat diminiſhed, &amp; not extinguiſhed: and therefore ſo ſoone as the holy Ghoſt toucheth, &amp; enlighteneth the heart, it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth together with the ſame ſpirit, freely aſſenting vnto the ſame. This preparation hath ſeauen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Biel. 4. book. 14. diſt. 2. queſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt is faith, which is a knowledge and an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, whereby men agree that thoſe things are true which are deliuered concerning God, and his will, reuealed in the word of God.</p>
            <p>This is the foundaion of iuſtification, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the heart: becauſe it ſtirreth vp free wil that it may affect the hart with thoſe motions by which it is prepared to iuſtification.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt act of faith is to apprehend the vgli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſinne, and the wages thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">II. After this followeth a feare of Gods anger, and of hell fire.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Then begin men to diſlike, and in ſome ſort to deteſt ſinne.</p>
            <p>From theſe ariſeth a certaine diſpoſition which hath annexed vnto it, the <hi>merite of congruitie,</hi> yet not immediate nor ſufficient, but imperfect.</p>
            <p n="4">IIII. At the length, faith returneth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Gods mercies, and beleeueth that God is readie to forgiue ſinnes by the infuſion of charitie into thoſe, which are before ſufficiently prepared and diſpoſed.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Out of this contemplation proceedeth the act of hope, whereby faith beginneth to deſire and
<pb facs="tcp:5274:148"/>
to waite on God, as the cheefeſt good.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Out of this act of hope ariſeth loue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God is loued aboue all things in the world.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. After this loue followeth a newe diſlike, and deteſtation of ſinne, not ſo much in regarde of feare of the puniſhment in hell fire, as in regarde of the offence to God, who is ſimply loued more then all other things.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. After all theſe followeth a purpoſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life: and heere comes in the merit of congruitie, that is ſufficient: or els, the immediate, ſufficient and laſt diſpoſition before the infuſion of grace.</p>
            <p>The third degree of predeſtination, is the firſt iuſtification, whereby men of vniuſtare are made iuſt, not onely through the remiſsion of their ſinnes, but alſo by a ſanctification of the inwarde man, by his voluntarie receiuing of grace and giftes.</p>
            <p>The efficient cauſe of this iuſtification, is the mercy of God, and the meritorious paſsion of our Sauiour Chriſt, whereby he purchaſed iuſtification for men. The inſtrumentall cauſe is baptiſme. The formall cauſe is not that iuſtice, which was inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Chriſt, but which he infuſeth into man: and that is eſpecially hope and charitie.</p>
            <p>The fourth degree is the ſecond iuſtification whereby men are of iuſt, made more iuſt: the cauſe hereof is faith, ioyned with good workes.</p>

            <p>The fift degree is the reparation of a ſinner by the ſacrament of Penance. The which is as it were, the ſecond boord after a ſhipwracke. The cauſe why this reparation is neceſſarie, is, becauſe men looſe the grace of iuſtification by euery mortall ſinne.</p>
            <p>The laſt degree is the fruite of Iuſtification: which is nothing els, but the meritorious rewarde of good workes, namely eternall life, which the good workes of ſuch as are in the eſtate of grace do <hi>ex condigno,</hi> that is, of ſufficient worthines deſerue.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:5274:150"/>I. They make the name of Predeſtination pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per onely to the Elect, as though God had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated the reprobate, but onely foreknowen that ſuch ſhould bee reprobates: fearing leaſt in ſo doing, they ſhould make God a cauſe, why the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates are damned. But Gods <hi>foreknowledge</hi> may as well be termed ſuch a cauſe, as his predeſtination. Actes. 2.23. And Auguſtine acknowledgeth Gods predeſtination, as well in the reprobate as Elect. For, in his 15. booke of the Citie of God, 1. chap. he maketh all men Cittizens of one of theſe two Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, heauen and hell. The Cittizens of the one, are predeſtinate to reigne with God perpetually, the other, to ſuffer eternall puniſhment with the deuil and his Angels.</p>
               <p n="2">II. They teach, that Gods predeſtination is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: and ſo as that hee, whome God hath prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate to life, may for all that be condemned: and he, who in Gods foreknowledge is a reprobate, may afterward obtaine eternall life. All this is flat contrary: for God hath vndoubtedly &amp; vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably decreed, what ſhal become of euery man, who ſhalbe ſaued, and who ſhalbe condemned. Rom. 11.29. <hi>The gifts and calling of God, are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Math. 24.24. <hi>There ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſtes, and falſe prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders, ſo that (if it were poſſible) they ſhould deceiue the very Elect.</hi> Rom. 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? it is God that inſtifieth,</hi> verſe. 34. <hi>Who ſhall condemne? It is Chriſt which is dead, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 35. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt?</hi> 2. Tim.
<pb facs="tcp:5274:150"/>
2.19. <hi>This foundation ſtandeth ſure, The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> Againe, if we graunt this, it muſt needs follow that the foreknowledge of God may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, his will altered, &amp; his power weakned. The which is moſt blaſphemous to thinke, or ſay. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by this meanes, euery man ſhould be vncertaine of his predeſtination to life: and ſo that excellent and onely ſure groundworke of full aſſurance o ſaluation, is not onely ſore ſhaken, but quite and cleane ouerturned.</p>
               <p n="3">III. They teach, that God hath predeſtinate all to ſaluation: but <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Theſ. 2.10. faith plainely, <hi>that there are certaine men ordeined to deſtruction, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he diſtinguiſheth from the Elect,</hi> verſ. 13.2. Tim. 2.20. <hi>In a great houſe, there are not onely veſſels of gold, and of ſiluer, but alſo of wood &amp; of earth, and ſome for honour, and ſome for diſhonour.</hi> Math. 20.16. <hi>There are many called, but fewe choſen.</hi> And of ſo great a number of the Iewes, a remnant onely are ſaued. This alſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to ſet out Gods goodnes, in that his benefit is not common to all men. For we vſually admire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which is rare.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. They teach, that predeſtination, in regard of the laſt effect thereof, hath his cauſe in man: namely, in his free will and workes. For whom God hath foreſeene, that they would willingly receiue the grace of God offered them in Chriſt, &amp; which would lead their liues according to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, them did he predeſtinate: not by reaſon of their workes, but of his free grace, yet ſo, as that he had an eie or reſpect vnto the good works which
<pb facs="tcp:5274:151"/>
they would do. This their braineſick imagination, <hi>Paul</hi> vtterly ouerthroweth, when he teacheth. Eph. 1.4. that God hath choſen the Epheſians before the foundations of the world were laid, not becauſe he did foreſee that they would be holy, <hi>but that they ſhould be holy &amp; without blame before him in loue.</hi> Tit. 2.12. Furthermore, ſeeing there is nothing either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue God, or greater then God, it is palpable impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie to ſet downe any cauſe of his wil, which ſhould be either without, or aboue himſelfe. Therefore we doe not without good cauſe deny, that Gods foreknowledge of faith, and good workes in any, can be a motiue why God ſhould decree, that ſome men ſhould be ſaued.</p>
               <p n="5">V. They ſay, that Baptiſme truely adminiſtred, doth not onely waſh away the guiltineſſe, but alſo the corruption of original ſinne, in ſuch ſort, as that after it is no more accounted a ſinne. But contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is moſt certaine, that, howſoeuer the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſinne be taken away, yet that naturall pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and corruption, is not by and by extinguiſhed, but curbed, as it were, and kept vnder, that it beare not a ful ſway in man. For if it were otherwiſe, why ſhould <hi>Paul</hi> ſo bewaile his originall corruption, as he doth, <hi>I ſee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>an other law in my members, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt the law of my minde, and leading me cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to the lawe of ſinne, which is in my members: miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of death?</hi> And the ſame <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.13. calleth originall ſinne, <hi>the worker of death.</hi>

               <p>Againe, concupiſcence is the very root of actuall

ſinne: therefore it muſt needes be properly a ſinne, euen after Baptiſme. Iames. 1.14. Laſtly, vnleſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence were of the ſame nature with ſinne, that vehement and earneſt combate betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, would preſently ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. They teach, that the power of freewil, which man receiued of God, to doe that which is good, is onely leſſened before true conuerſion, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed: and therfore that it is poſsible for man, to prepare himſelfe for Iuſtification.

Eph. 4.24.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. They teach, that in man there is a natural preparation to Grace: and that it dooth by a merit, which is of ſufficient worthines, deſerue iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This poſition ſauoureth of more then Sathani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call pride. For can any man thinke, (vnleſſe he be beſides himſelfe) that hee, who deſerueth infinite thouſand damnations, can deſerue the leaſt droppe of grace? 2. Cor. 3.5.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb facs="tcp:5274:152"/>IX. They teach, that that faith, which they make to be the maine pillar of mans iuſtification, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but a knowledge and illumination of the minde, concerning the trueth of Gods word. The which if it be ſo, I would faine know why the deuil might not be ſaued, who hath this faith, which is the ground of iuſtification with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; yet, albeit he haue this faith, no man wil be ſo ſimple, as to think, that he is, or can be, accounted one of the faithfull.</p>
               <p n="10">X. They maintaine, that the loue of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth before reconciliation with God, which is made in the worke of iuſtification: but contrarily, vnleſſe we were ſurely perſwaded of Gods loue to vs, in the iuſtifying and ſanctifying, it were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for vs to loue God. 1. Ioh. 4.14. <hi>We loue him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loued vs first.</hi> Euen as we ſee that the ſun by his heat, muſt firſt warme the aire, before the aire by any heate of his, can warme our bodies.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. They ſay, that the formall cauſe of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is inherent iuſtice. But albeit, this infuſed and inherent iuſtice, hath indeed his vſe, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and reward: neuertheleſſe, becauſe it is in this life, by reaſon of the fleſh, imperfect, and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh) it cannot ſtand before Gods iudgement ſeate, and acquite any man from the ſentence of condemnation, ſo as he might become heyre of eternall life.</p>
               <p>They will heere further ſay, that God dooth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this inherent righteouſnes, as a mercifull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This I graunt, neuertheles, Gods iuſtice muſt bee ſatiſfied, or elſe wee are damned. Wherefore
<pb facs="tcp:5274:152"/>
Chriſts obedience, apprehended by a true and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, is to be accounted the true eſſence of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. In temptation and the combate with ſinne and Satan, faith doth not reaſon thus: Now I haue charetie and inherent iuſtice, and therfore God wil receiue me into his mercy; But faith dooth rather looke directlye to the Sonne of God, who was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for vs, and ſitteth at the right hand of the Father, making interceſsion for vs: to him dooth faith flie, and is perſwaded that for his cauſe, our ſinnes are pardoned, and we reconciled to God, and that we are accounted iuſt, not by any inherent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, but by the merite of Chriſts death and paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Rom. 5.19.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. That deuiſed ſubtiltye of ſecond Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a meere deluſion of the deuill. For firſt, the word of God alloweth none other iuſtification but one: there is one onelye iuſtice, and one onelye ſatiſfaction of the wrath of God. Secondlye, if the increaſe of inherent iuſtice, were a ſufficient cauſe, to diſtinguiſhe iuſtification, they might as well make an hundreth iuſtifications, as two. Thirdlye, where as they ſay, that men are iuſtified by good works, it is both falſe and rediculous. Falſe, 1. All workes, yea thoſe which are done after we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into Gods fauour, are excluded from iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying. Eph. 2.10, Rom. 3.28. <hi>We conclude that a man is iuſtified by faith, without the workes of the Law.</hi> Where <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh not of ceremoniall, but of morall woorkes doone vnder grace. 2. The cauſe of the cauſe, is the cauſe alſo of that, which is cauſed, but
<pb facs="tcp:5274:153"/>
grace without works is the cauſe of predeſtination, which is the cauſe of iuſtification: therefore grace without woorkes, ſhall much more be the cauſe of iuſtification. I ſay it is alſo ridiculous, becauſe to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that inherent iuſtice maye be increaſed by good workes, which are the fruite thereof, is as if one ſhould ſaye, that the Vine is more ſtrong and liuelye by bearing Grapes: and that the inward brightnes of the ſunne is made greater, by ſending forth of beames. That ſaying of <hi>Luther</hi> is moſt true: Good works maketh not a man iuſt, but a iuſt man maketh good workes. For good fruit maketh not a good tree, but declareth it to be good, but a good tree muſt needs make good fruit.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. They affirme, that euerye mortall ſinne extinguiſheth grace, the which, if we may beleeue Gods woord, is farre otherwiſe. Iohn. 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giueth me, ſhall come to me: and him that commeth to me, J caſt not away.</hi> Mat. 16.16. <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke will J builde my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt it.</hi> 1. Iohn. 2.19. <hi>They went out from vs, but they were not of vs: for, if they had beene of vs, they would haue continued with vs.</hi> Rom. 5.1. <hi>We being then iuſtified, we haue peace with God.</hi> Now how can this be true, if he, that is once iuſtified may fall from grace.</p>
               <p n="14">XIIII. They affirme, that workes doo of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent worthines, merit eternall life. Here we muſt conſider, that, if any worke be meritorious, it muſt firſt be equiualent and proportionall to the iuſtice of God: ſecondly, God muſt receiue it vpon deſert, not vpon fauour: Now for our workes, look to the
<pb facs="tcp:5274:153"/>
holyeſt, and they are verye imperfect: and if ſo be they were in perfection anſwerable to the law, yet were they no more, then we are bound by duetye to perfourme. And indeede nothing can merite ought at Gods handes, but the woorkes of Chriſt. For the humanitie of Chriſt giueth the matter of a meritorious worke: and his deity, whereunto his humanity is, by an hypoſtaticall vnion vnited, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth ſufficient merit and worthines to the ſame worke. This alſo may we adde, that the doctrine of workes, doth greatly darken the merit of Chriſt: becauſe the obtaining of eternall life is detracted from Chriſtes death and obedience, and attributed to workes. <hi>For</hi> (ſay theſe men) <hi>Chriſt by his paſsion deſerued that man ſhould be iuſtified, but man being iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, deſerued by his workes eternall life.</hi> Auguſtine hath a notable ſentence againſt this their doctrine in his 10. ſermon de verbis Apoſtoli. <hi>If God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>made vs men, and we our ſelues made vs good men, we haue made ſomewhat better then that which God hath made. For a man that is ſaued is better then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man. If therfore God made thee a man, and thou didſt make thy ſelfe a good man, that which thou didſt make, is better then that which God made. Lift not thy ſelf againſt God, ſubmit rather thy ſelfe and reuerence him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">XV. They ſay, that without eſpeciall reuelation, no man knoweth whether he be predeſtinate. But it is out of all contrauerſie, that God by his Spirite, word, and effects of predeſtination, giueth certain teſtimonies to ſuch as are his children, that they are elect and ſhalbe ſaued. 1. Cor. 1.12. <hi>We haue not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:154"/>
that we might know the things which are giuen vs of God.</hi> Luke. 10.20. <hi>Reioyce that your names are written in the booke of life.</hi> But no man can reioyce for any good which he aſſuredly knoweth not.</p>

c. 103. <hi>The Scripture</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ſpeaketh of God, that he would haue all to be ſaued, not as though there were none whom he would haue condemned, ſeeing he would not ſhew his miracles to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who if he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them any, they would as he himſelfe ſaith, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented: But we muſt vnderſtand by all men all ſortes of men, whether kinges or ſubiects, or any other condition whatſoeuer, &amp;c.</hi> And in his booke de Corrept. &amp; Gratia. c. 14. <hi>It is ſaid, that he will haue all to be ſaued, namely, ſuch as are predeſtinate to ſaluation, becauſe of all ſorts of men ſome are predeſtinate, as it is ſpoken of the Pharaſies, Ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ithe euery herb.</hi> Whereas Peter ſaith. 2. Pet. 3.9. <hi>God would haue no man to periſh, but all men to come to repentance, this muſt be vnderſtood of al the elect: becauſe he ſpeaketh of ſuch as are faithfull, &amp; ſanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the place in Ezek. 18.23. <hi>God will not the death of a ſinner:</hi> we muſt holde this, that <hi>(God will)</hi> is not, as it is the ouerthrowe and deſtruction of his creature: yet may he be ſaid to will it another way: namely, as death is a puniſhment, and meanes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the iuſtice of God.</p>
            <p>Now in that Iohn ſaith. 1. Iohn. 2.2. <hi>That Chriſt is a propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole worlde:</hi> his meaning is not, that all the world ſhalbe ſaued, but that the elect, choſen out of all the world, ſhal haue Chriſt their propitiatour. For ſo ſaith Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that <hi>he asketh not for the world, but for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom the father hath giuen him out of the world.</hi> Now it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, that he ſhould be a propitiation for them, for whom he doth not vouchſafe to pray.</p>
            <p>Secondly it is falſe that God will haue none dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb facs="tcp:5274:156"/>
For ſeeing that ſome men are condemned, it muſt needes be either with his will, or without his will. If without his will, then violence ſhalbe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to the will of God, ſomething being doone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, which is impious once to thinke, if with it God muſt needes change his minde, which cannot be. Neither is there any cauſe why we ſhould think that God is an accepter of perſons, if ſo be he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine any to condemnation: becauſe he was not moued hereunto by any inherent circumſtance of any mans perſon: neither oweth he ought to any man, and may do with his own that which ſeemeth good vnto him.</p>
            <p>Neither muſt any thinke that hereby God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his creature: for he decreede to deſtroye his workemanſhip, not becauſe he hated it, but vpon iuſt cauſes known to him, he ordeined it to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to his hatred. And God doth not actually hate any thing for ought but ſinne. That ſaying of Aug. to Simpl. is a true ſaying. <hi>When God maketh the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, whom he doth not iuſtifie, veſſels of wrath, he dooth it not to hate that which he made: for in that he made them veſſels, they haue their vſe, namely, that by their paines to which they were ordeined, the veſſels of honour might reap profit. God therfore doth not hate them, in that they are men, or veſſels, neither any thing that he made in them by creation, or ordination. For God hateth nothing which he hath made. But in as much as he made them veſſels of deſtruction, he did it to inſtruct others. As for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie which he neuer made, that he hateth vtterlye. As therefore a iudge hateth theft in a man, but he dooth not
<pb facs="tcp:5274:156"/>
hate his puniſhment that he is ſent to worke in the mines. For the theefe doth the firſt, the Judge the latter: ſo God, whereas of the company of them which periſh, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth veſſels of perdition, he dooth not therefore hate that which he doth, that is, the condemnation of thoſe which periſh in their due puniſhment for ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any oppoſe againſt this, the place of Mal. 2.10. <hi>That God is the Father of all:</hi> they muſt conſider that it is to be vnderſtoode of Gods Church: out of which all the corrupt poſteritye of Adam are the ſonnes of wrath, and children of Satan. Epheſ. 2.2. Ioh. 8.44. Laſt of all this reaſon muſt not be vrged, that God created any to the end he might deſtroye them. For the ende of euerye mans creation is the glorye of God: to the manifeſtation whereof the wicked were ordeined. Pro. 16.4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, wheras they ſay, that God did onelye foreknow, and not from eternitie decree, the fall of Adam, it is moſt impious. For there is not the verie leaſt thing in nature, but it commeth to paſſe by Gods decree. Mat. 10.30. Yea, thoſe actions which are ſin, the Lord hath in his counſell determined of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Act. 4.28. Therfore, if any be of this mind, they either ouerturn Gods prouidence and counſel, or at the leaſt, make it to be but a fond &amp; idle ſpeculatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this is a prepoſterous doctrine, namely, that God did firſte foreknow the fall of mankinde in Adam: and after that ordained ſuch as he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew, to death or life. For the end is alwaies firſt in the intent of the agent. Again, the fall of Adam is a ſubordinate means, wherby God doth execute the
<pb facs="tcp:5274:157"/>
decree of predeſtination. Therefore no man may think, that God firſt tooke counſell of the meanes wherby his decree might be accompliſhed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward conſidered of the thing to be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that is, of the decree of his election and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, it is not true, that all men are called to ſaluation: and that therefore that grace which is in Chriſt, is offred to all: and that God decreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect ſome, for their vnbeliefe which he foreſawe in them. For many children of faithfull parents haue died before they had any vſe of reaſon at all: ye ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of riper yeres, which haue not had ſo much as a glimmering of Chriſt. Act. 14.16. Andal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit a man ſhould neuer contemne the Goſpell, yet the corruption of originall ſinne, were enough to condemne the whole world. Againe, that great admiration of Paul. Rom. 9.20. <hi>O man, who art thou which pleadeſt againſt God?</hi> ſheweth manifeſtly that the cauſe why God decreed to reiect ſome is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, and that it dooth not depend vpon his foreſight, that ſuch would ſpurne againſt the grace offered them in the Goſpell. Aug. hath a fit ſpeech for this purpoſe. Epiſt. 105. <hi>Who,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the reprobate, but God? and why? becauſe it was his good pleaſure? But why was it his pleaſure? O man, what art thou which diſputeſt with God?</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:157"/>IN the execution of this decree, there is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, the foundation or beginning, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees or proceeding therof.</p>
            <p>The foundation of executing the decree of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is the fal of Adam, by which fal he was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect both to ſin &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation. Ro. 11.32. <hi>For God hath ſhut vp al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in vnbeliefe, that he might haue mercye on all.</hi> 1. Pet. 2.8. Here we muſt note, that God hath ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to condemne ſome, as that notwithſtanding all the fault and guilt of condemnation remaineth in the men only.</p>
            <p>Further, whom God reiecteth to condemnation, thoſe he hateth: this hatred of God is, whereby he deteſteth &amp; abhorreth the reprobate whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into ſin, for the ſame ſin. And this hatred which God hath to man, comes by the fal of Adam: and it is neither an antecedent or a cauſe of Gods decree, but only a conſequent and followeth the decree.</p>
            <p>Reprobates are either infants, or men of riper age.</p>
            <p>In reprobate infants, the execution of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is this: aſſoone as they are borne, for the guilt of originall and naturall ſinne being left in Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret iudgement vnto themſelues, they dying are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected of God for euer. Rom. 5.14. <hi>But death reigned from Adam to Moſes, euen ouer them alſo that ſinned not after the like maner of the tranſgreſsion of Adam, which was the figure of him that was to come.</hi> Ro. 9.11. <hi>For yet the children were borne, and when they had neither done good nor euill, that the purpoſe of God might remaine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to election, not by workes, but by him that calleth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:158"/>Reprobates of riper age, are of 2. ſorts, they that are called (namelye by an vneffectuall calling) and they that are not called.</p>
            <p>In the Reprobates which are called, the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the decree of reprobation hath 3. degrees, to wit, an acknowledgement of Gods calling, a falling away againe, and condemnation.</p>
            <p>The acknowledgement of Gods calling, is, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Reprobates for a time doe ſubiect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the calling of God, which calling is wrought by the preaching of the word. Matth. 22.14. <hi>For many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> And of this calling there are fiue other degrees.</p>
            <p>The firſt, is an enlightning of their mindes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are inſtructed of the holy Ghoſt to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and knowledge of the worde. Heb. 6.4. <hi>For it is impoſsible that they which were once light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Pet. 2.20. <hi>For if they, after they haue eſcaped from the filthines of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord, and of the ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, are yet tangled againe therin, and ouercome, the latter end is worſe with them then the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond, is a certaine penitencie, wherby the reprobate, I. Doth know his ſin. II. Is pricked with the feeling of Gods wrath, for ſin. III. Is greeued for the puniſhment of ſin. IIII. Doth confeſſe his ſin. V. Acknowledgeth God to be iuſt in puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſin. VI. Deſireth to be ſaued. VII. Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth repentance in his miſerie or affliction, in theſe words. <hi>I will ſin no more.</hi> Mat. 27.3. <hi>Then when Iudas which betraied him ſaw that he was condemned, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
<pb facs="tcp:5274:158"/>
himſelfe, and brought againe the thirtie peeces of ſiluer, to the cheefe Preeſts and Elders.</hi> Heb. 12.17. <hi>For ye know how that afterward alſo when he would haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited the bleſsing, he was reiected: for he found no place to repentance, though he ſought the bleſsing with teares.</hi> 1. King 21.27. <hi>Now when Ahab heard thoſe wordes, he rent his clothes, and put ſackcloth vpon him, and faſted, and laye in Sackecloth, and went ſoftlye.</hi> Nomb. 23.10. <hi>Let me dye the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his.</hi> Pſalm. 78.32. <hi>For all this they ſinned ſtill, and beleeued not his wonderous woorkes.</hi> Verſe 33. <hi>Therfore their daies did he conſume in vanitie, and their yeeres haſtily.</hi> Verſe 34. <hi>And when he ſlew them, they ſought him, and they returned, and ſought God earlye.</hi> Ver. 35. <hi>They remembred that God was their ſtrength, and the moſt high God their redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third degree is, a temporarie faith, wherby the reprobate doth confuſedly beleeue the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, made in Chriſt, I ſaye, <hi>confuſedlye,</hi> becauſe he beleeueth that ſome ſhall be ſaued, but he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not that he himſelfe particularly ſhalbe ſaued, becauſe he being content with a generall faith, doth neuer apply the promiſes of God to himſelfe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he ſo much as conceiue any purpoſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or endeauour to apply the ſame, or any wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or ſtriuing againſt ſecuririe or careleſnes and diſtruſt. Iam. 2.19. <hi>Thou beleueſt that there is one God, thou doeſt well: the deuils alſo beleeue it, and tremble.</hi> Matth. 13.20. <hi>And he that receiued ſeede in the ſtonye ground, is he which heareth the woord, and incontinentlye with ioy receiueth it.</hi> 21. <hi>Yet hath he no roote in himſelfe,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:159"/>
and dureth but a ſeaſon.</hi> Ioh. 2.23. <hi>Now when he was at Jeruſalem at the Paſſeouer in the feaſt, many beleeued in his name, when they ſaw his miracles which he did.</hi> v. 24. <hi>But Ieſus did not commit himſelfe vnto them, becauſe he knew them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth is, a taſting of heauenly gifts: as of Iuſtification, and of Sanctification, and of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the world to come. This taſting is verilye a ſence in the harts of the reprobates, whereby they doe perceiue and feele the excellency of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they do not enioy the ſame. For it is one thing to taſte of dainties at a banquet, &amp; another thing to feed &amp; to be nouriſhed therby. Heb. 6.4. <hi>For it is impoſsible, that they which were once lightned, and haue taſted of the heauenlye gifte, and were made partakers of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fift degree, is the outward holynes of life for a time, vnder which, is comprehended the zeale in the profeſsion of Religion, a reuerence and feare towards Gods miniſters, and amendment of life in many thinges. Mark 6.20. <hi>For Herod feared Iohn, knowing that he was a iuſt man and an holy, and reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, and when he heard him, he did many thinges, and heard him gladly.</hi> Actes 8.13. <hi>Then Simon himſelfe beleeued alſo, and was baptized, and continued with Philip, and wondred when he ſaw the ſignes and great miracles which were done.</hi> Hoſe. 6.4. <hi>O Ephraim, what ſhall I do vnto thee? O Iudah, how ſhall I entreate thee? for your goodnes is as a morning cloud, and as the morning dew, it goeth away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond degree of the execution of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:5274:159"/>
counſell of reprobation, in men of ripe age which are called, is a falling away againe, which for the moſt part is effected and wrought after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Firſt, the reprobate is deceiued by ſome ſinne. Secondlye, his hart is hardned by the ſame ſinne. Thirdlye, his hart being hardned, it becommeth wicked and peruerſe. Fourthly, then followeth his incredulitie and vnbeliefe, whereby he conſenteth not to Gods word, when he hath heard &amp; knowen it. Fiftly, an Apoſtacie or falling away from faith in Chriſt, dooth immediatlye followe this vnbeliefe. Heb. 3.12, 13. <hi>Take heede brethren, leaſt at any time there be in any of you an euill hart, and vnfaithfull, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part away from the liuing God.</hi> 1. Tim. 1.19.</p>
            <p>This Apoſtacie, is ſometimes ſinne againſt the holye Ghoſt, which is, when any man willinglye through obſtinate malice, dooth ſpeake blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye againſt Chriſt and his diuine truth, which he hath certainly knowen. This obſtinacie of the hart ariſeth from the olde and engraffed affections, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, enuye, and malice, directly againſt God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and Chriſt. It hath his name, not becauſe it is committed againſt the perſon of the holy ſpirite, but becauſe it is done againſt the gift of the holye Ghoſt, namelye, Illumination. This cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, becauſe it excludeth all faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Heb. 6.4 and chap. 10. ver. 26. <hi>For if we ſinne willingly after that we haue receiued the trueth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more ſacrifice for ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Apoſtacie followeth pollutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which is the very fulnes of all iniquity, altogither contrarye to
<pb facs="tcp:5274:160"/>
ſanctification. Gene. 15.16. <hi>And in the fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they ſhall come hither againe, for the wickednes of the Amorites is not yet full.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third degree, is damnation, wherby the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates are deliuered vp to eternall puniſhment. The execution of damnation beginneth in death, and is finiſhed in the laſt iudgement. Luke. 16.22. <hi>And it was ſo, that the begger died, and was caried by the Angell into Abrahams boſome, the rich man alſo died, and was buried.</hi> ver. 23. <hi>And being in hell tormentes, he lift vp his eyes and ſaw Abraham a farre off, and Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus in his boſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The execution of the degree of reprobation in Infidels, which are not called, is this. Firſt, they haue by nature ignorance and vanitie of minde. After that, followeth hardnes of hart, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come void of all ſorow for their ſinnes. Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a reprobate ſence, which is, when the naturall light of reaſon and of the iudgement of good and euill is extinguiſhed. Afterward when the hart ceaſeth to ſorrow, then ariſeth a committing of ſin with greedines. Then commeth pollution, which is the fulnes of ſinne. Laſtlye, a iuſt reward is giuen to all theſe, to wit, fearefull condemnation. Epheſ. 4.18. <hi>Hauing their cogitation darkened, and being ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the hardnes of their hartes.</hi> Rom. 1.28. <hi>For as they regarded not to know God, euen ſo God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them vp vnto a reprobate minde, to doe thoſe things which are not conuenient.</hi>

            <p>THe death of the Reprobate, is a ſeparation of the body and the ſoule: of the bodie, that for a time it may lie dead in the earth: of the ſoule, that it may feele the torments of hell, euen vntill the time of the laſt iudgement: at which time the whole man ſhall be caſt into the moſt terrible and fearefull fire of hell. 1. Pet. 3.19. <hi>By the which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo went, and preached vnto the ſpirites that are in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Luke. 8.2.

            </p>
            <p>The reprobates when they die, doe become without ſence and aſtonied, like vnto a ſtone: or elſe they are ouerwhelmed with a terrible horrour of conſcience, and deſpairing of their ſaluation, as it were, with the gulfe of the ſea ouerturning them. 1. Sam. 25.37. <hi>Then in the morning when the wine was gone out of Nabal, his wife told him thoſe wordes, and his heart died within him, and he was like a ſtone.</hi> verſe. 38. <hi>And about ten daies after the Lorde ſmote Nabal that he died.</hi> Math. 27.5. <hi>And when hee had caſt downe the ſiluer peeces in the temple, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and went and hanged himſelfe.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. 57.</hi> Of the Application of Predeſtination.</head>
            <p>THe right applying of Predeſtination to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of men, is very neceſſarie: and it hath two partes. The firſt, is the iudgement of particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, and the ſecond, is the vſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:162"/>The iudgement and diſcerning of a mans owne predeſtination, is to be perfourmed by meanes of theſe rules which follow.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Elect alone, and all they that are elect, not onely may be, but alſo in Gods good time, are ſure of election in Chriſt to eternal life. 1. Cor. 2.12, 2. Cor. 13.5.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They haue not this knowledge from the firſt cauſes of Election, but rather from the laſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof: and they are eſpecially two: The teſtimonie of Gods Spirite, and the workes of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. 2. Pet. 1.10. Rom. 8.16.</p>
            <p n="3">III. If any doubt of this teſtimonie, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto them, whether it come from the Spirite of God, or their owne carnall preſumption. Firſt, by a full perſwaſion which they ſhall haue, for the holy Ghoſt will not barely ſay it, but perſwadeth ſuch, that they are the children of God, the which the fleſh cannot in any wiſe doe. Secondly, by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſwaſion: for the holy Ghoſt draweth not reaſons from the workes, or worthineſſe of man, but from Gods fauour and loue: and this kinde of perſwaſion is farre different from that kinde, which Satan vſeth. Thirdly, by the effects of that teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. For if the perſwaſion ariſe from preſumption, it is a dead perſwaſion: but contrarily, it is moſt liuely and ſtirring, if it come from the holy Ghoſt. For ſuch as are perſwaded that they are elected, and adopted children of God, they will loue God, they will truſt in him, and they will call vpon him with their whole heart.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:163"/>IV. If the teſtimonie of Gods Spirit, be not ſo powerful in the elect, then may they iudge of their electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by that other effect of the holy Ghoſt: nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: like as we vſe to iudge by heat that there is fire, when we cannot ſee the flame it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="5">V. And of al the effects of ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, theſe are moſt notable. I. To feele our wants, &amp; in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of heart, to bewaile the offence of God in euery ſin. II. To ſtriue againſt the fleſh, that is, to reſiſt, &amp; hate the vngodly motions thereof, &amp; with griefe to thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> burthenous &amp; troubleſome. III. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire earneſtly and vehemently the grace of God, &amp; merit of Chriſt to obtain eternall life. IIII. When it is obtained, to accounte it a moſt precious iewell. Phil. 3.8. V. To loue the miniſter of Gods word, in that he is a miniſter, &amp; a chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in that he is a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: and for that cauſe, if need require, to be ready to ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our bloud with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Mat. 10.42. 1. Ioh. 3.16. VI. To cal vpon God earneſtly, &amp; with teares. VII. To deſire &amp; loue Chriſts comming, and the day of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that an end may be made of the daies of ſin. VIII. To flie al occaſions of ſin, and ſeriouſly to endeuour to come to newnes of life. IX. To perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in theſe things to the laſt gaſpe of life. Luther hath a good ſentence for this purpoſe, <hi>He that will ſerue God, muſt (ſaith he) beleeue that which cannot be ſeene, hope for that which is deferred, &amp; loue God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſheweth himſelfe an enemie, and thus remaine to the end.</hi> Now, if ſo be al the effects of the ſpirit are very feeble in the godly, they muſt know this, that God trieth them, yet ſo, as they muſt not therewith be
<pb facs="tcp:5274:163"/>
diſmayed, becauſe it is moſt ſure, that if they haue faith, but as much as a grane of muſtard ſeed, and as weake as a young infant is, it is ſufficient to ingraffe them into Chriſt, &amp; therfore we muſt not doubt of their election, becauſe they ſee their faith foeble, &amp; the effects of the holy Ghoſt faint within them.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Neither muſt he, that as yet hath not felt in his heart any of theſe effects, preſently conclude, that hee is a reprobate: but let him rather vſe the word of God, and the ſacraments, that he may haue an inward ſenſe of the power of Chriſt, drawing him vnto him, and an aſſurance of his redemption by Chriſtes death and paſsion.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. No man may peremptorily ſet down, that he, or any other is a reprobate. For God dooth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prefer thoſe, which did ſeeme to be moſt of all eſtraunged from his fauor, to be in his kingdom, aboue thoſe, who in mans iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the kingdom. Hence is it, that Chriſt ſaith: <hi>The Publicanes and harlots goe before you:</hi> and, <hi>manie an one is called at the eleuenth houre,</hi> as appeareth by that notable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the theefe vpon the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>The vſes, which may be made of this doctrine of predeſtination, are very many. Firſt, for our inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are taught theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That there is neither any iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by works, nor any works of ours that are meritorious. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is by the free grace of God: &amp; therefore in like ſort is iuſtification. For (as I ſaid before) the cauſe of the cauſe, is the cauſe of the thing cauſed. And for this reaſon, is the worke of ſaluation, grace in
<pb facs="tcp:5274:164"/>
the matter of ſaluation dooth challenge the whole worke to it ſelfe. Rom. 11.5. <hi>At this time there is a remnant through the election of grace.</hi> 2. Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaued vs, and called vs with an holy calling, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our workes, but according to his owne purpoſe and grace, which was giuen to vs, through Chriſt Ieſus, before the world was.</hi> Phil. 1.29. <hi>Vnto you it is giuen for Chriſt, that not onely yee ſhould beleeue in him, but alſo ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> Rom. 3.24. <hi>We are iuſtified freely by grace.</hi> Tit. 3.5. <hi>Not by the workes of righteouſneſſe, which we had done, but according to his mercie he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs.</hi> Ezech. 36.27. <hi>I will cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes.</hi> Roman. 6.23. <hi>The gift of God is eternall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That Aſtrologie, teaching, by the caſting of Natiuities, what men will be, is ridiculous, and impious: becauſe it determineth, that ſuch ſhalbe very like in life, and conuerſation, whome God in his predeſtination hath made vnlike. Iaakob and Eſau, borne of the ſame parents, and almoſt in the ſame moment of time, (for Iaakob held Eſau by the heele, as he was borne) were of moſt vnlike diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and had diuers euents. The like may wee ſee in all twinnes, and others which are borne at the ſame time.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That God is moſt Wiſe, Omnipotent, Iuſt, and mercifull. <hi>O the wonderfull riches, both of the wiſedome and knowledge of God! how vnſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are his iudgements, and his waies past finding out!</hi> Epheſi. 1.5. <hi>Who hath predestinate vs, to bee adopted through Ieſus Chriſt vnto himſelfe, according to the
<pb facs="tcp:5274:164"/>
good pleaſure of his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, beeing the ſeruants of Chriſt, we are admoniſhed.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To fight againſt all doubting and diffidence of our ſaluation, becauſe it neither dependeth vpon workes, nor faith, but vpon Gods decree which is immutable. Math. 24.24. Luk. 10.20. <hi>Reioyce that your names are written in the booke of life.</hi> Rom. 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? it is God that iuſtifieth, who ſhall condemne?</hi> 2. Tim. 2.19. This teacheth, that the anker of hope muſt be fixed in the trueth, and ſtabilitie of the immutable good pleaſure of God: ſo that albeit our faith be ſo toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as that it is in danger of ſhip wracke, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it muſt neuer ſinke to the bottome, but euen in the middes of daunger, take holde vpon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as on a board, and ſo recouer it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To hubmle our ſoules vnder the mightie hand of God: For we are as clay in the hand of the potter. Rom. 9.21. <hi>They through infidelitie are broken off, but thou ſtandeſt through faith. Be not his minded but feare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. To giue all glorie to God. 2. Theſ. 2.13. <hi>Wee ought to giue thankes alway to God for you brethren, beloued of the Lord, becauſe that God hath from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning choſen you to ſaluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IIII. To beare croſſes patiently. Rom. 8.29. <hi>Thoſe which he knewe before, he alſo predeſtinate, to be made like to the image of his Sonne.</hi> This likeneſſe to Chriſt, is in bearing afflictions. Phil. 3.10. <hi>That I may knowe him, and the vertue of his reſurrection, and</hi>
               <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:165"/>
ſaued. <hi>And by Paul,</hi> Yee which are baptized, haue put on Chriſt. <hi>Dauid being armed with the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from his circumciſion, feared not to ioyne battell with that great Gyant Goliah: and if this were not ſo, it muſt needes followe, that Baptiſme were nothing elſe but an idle ceremonie, and alſo the perſons of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie would bee thought lyers. Wherefore thoſe afflicted men, when Satan aſſaulteth them, muſt reſiſt him with theſe wordes: Departe from mee Sathan, thou haſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parte nor portion in the inheritance of my ſoule, becauſe I am baptized in the Name of the holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſo am truely made the Sonne of God by adoption.</hi> And are theſe the ſtrong weapons, which ſo many times, and in ſo many wordes, haue beene obiected againſt me by D. Andreas? and whereby hee hath gotten the victorie? but becauſe this his reaſon is ſomewhat intricate, I will explane it after this ſorte. Firſt, for the place of Scripture which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, namely, that <hi>God is greater then our hearts.</hi> It is ſo farre from comforting an afflicted conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it will rather driue him to deſpaire. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dooth <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>epist.</hi> 3.20. make mention of it, to eaſe ſuch as are in deſpaire, ſhewing vnto them by that ſentence, the greatneſſe of Gods mercies: but rather that he might thereby, euen bruiſe in pieces, the hearts of proud perſons, when they conſider the greatnes of Gods maieſtie. And for the other place, when as a man doubteth of his ſaluation, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no teſtimonies of faith in himſelfe, (for ſuch an one we here ſpeake of) what comfort, thinke you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:5274:165"/>
               <hi>is baptized, ſhalbe ſaued?</hi> For he would rather reaſon contrarily, thus: I indeed am baptized, yet for all that I beleeue not, and therefore my baptiſme is not auaileable, I muſt needs be condemned. For the ſaying of Auguſt. in his treatiſe vpon <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. is very true, who ſpeaking of Simon Magus, ſaith, <hi>What good did it him to be baptized? Brag not therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thou art baptized, as though that were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee, to inherit the kingdom of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> As for the place of Paul, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. I ſhewed plainely before, how D. Andreas did violently wreſt it to his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Neither are his reaſons, taken from the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that would follow, of more force then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, albeit he maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſpeciall pillars to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop the truth of his cauſe. For, I pray you, is God of leſſe trueth, becauſe his trueth is neglected, &amp; deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them that contemne it? Is the ceremonie of Baptiſme therfore in vaine, becauſe ſome refuſe the grace offred in baptiſme: others (if we may beleeue D. Andreas) reiect that grace when they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it? What? Is not the Goſpel therfore the power of God to ſaluation, becauſe it is to ſuch as beleeue not the ſauour of death to eternall death? May not the Supper of the Lord, be a pledge of Gods coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, becauſe ſo many abuſe theſe holy ſignes, or (as D. Andreas is of opinion) the very body &amp; bloud of our Sauiour Chriſt? And, that I may reaſon fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is true in the experience of euery childe, can the ſunne be ſaid to be without light, becauſe they which are blind, and aſleepe, haue no benefit by the light thereof, neither ſuch as ſhut their eyes ſo cloſe
<pb facs="tcp:5274:166"/>
that they will not enioy the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of the light? But amongſt all, this one is moſt childiſh, that D. Andr. will make this his principal argument, namely, that in vaine did men, thus tempted, flie at all vnto Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, vnleſſe we conclude with him, that all ſuch as are baptized, are in baptiſme adopted the ſonnes of God. For firſt, if this were a good conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: it were in vaine, for ſuch an afflicted conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to gather vnto himſelfe a teſtimonie from the word of God, &amp; the other Sacrament of the Lords Supper, vnleſſe we make all thoſe to be in like ſort regenerate, and adopted, vnto whom the word of God is preached, and the Lordes Supper admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred: either of which, for D. Andreas to affirme, is a bolde vntrueth.</p>
            <p>But to omit this, what if we graunt this which D. Andr, requireth concerning Baptiſme? may not for all that, any that is ſo tempted, by Satans pollicie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel this great comforter, by his own argument? after this ſort. I wil graunt D. Andr. your queſtion: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I haue been baptized, &amp; adopted the ſonne of God: yet ſeeing you teach, that the grace of God is not ſo ſure but that I may fal fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame, as indeed I feele that I haue greeuouſly fallen, what do ye now els but lift me vp with one hand to heauen, &amp; with the other caſt me downe into hel? What meane you therefore to teach me thoſe things which are ſo far from eaſing me, as that contrarily, they doe more and more lay out vnto me, mine abominable &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull heart? See nowe what ſure conſolation, conſciences greeuouſly afflicted may reape by this
<pb facs="tcp:5274:166"/>
doctrine of their comforter D. Andreas.</p>
            <p>Now if any be deſirous to know, what ſpirituall comfort is moſt meet to be miniſtred vnto conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſo troubled, I will ſhewe them that which is grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſure foundation, &amp; which I my ſelf haue often found to be true in mine owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: the which alſo I purpoſe to handle more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, for the benefit of the chriſtian reader. Firſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we teach, contrarily to that which D. Andreas doth moſt falſely obiect againſt vs, that the eternall decree, or as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeketh the purpoſe of God, muſt not be ſought in the bottomleſſe counſell of God, but rather in the manifeſtation of it, namely in his vocation, by the word &amp; ſacraments. This I ſpeake of ſuch as are of yeeres of diſcretion, as they muſt needs be, whom we ſeeke to comfort in this place.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe that externall vocation, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per onely to the elect <hi>(for many are called, but few are choſen)</hi> but ſuch a vocation as is effectuall, that is, whereby the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is not onely enlightned, with the ſauing knowledge of God, but in the will alſo there is created, a true, though not a perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſinne, from whence ariſeth an abhorring of ſinne, and loue of that which is good, or rather a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to will, and doe that which is right. Therefore when we ſee one thus dangerouſlie tempted, wee applie vnto his afflicted conſcience, that true Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penthes, and comfortable &amp; reſtoratiue medicine, which is taken from Gods effectuall vocation, as it were out of an Apothecaries boxe.</p>
            <p>If therefore I haue to doe with ſuch an one,

               </gap>ed by the preaching of the Goſpell, or if hee were called, yet ſeemeth both to himſelfe &amp; others neuer to haue regarded him that called: and hence concludeth that hee is not in the nomber of them who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath purpoſed to take pity vpon: I forthwith tell him, that Satan plaieth the Sophiſter, in teaching him thus to conclude: for this his reaſon is as vntrue, as if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> looking at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, &amp; ſeeing that the ſun is not then riſen, ſhould therfore affirme that it would neuer riſe. And this is that which when I obiected to D. Andreas. pag. 482. He very boldly corrupting my meaning, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this as mine aſſertion, <hi>Say vnto a man that is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, the ſun is riſen, although as yet it be not riſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But I teach not lies, howſoeuer this deprauation of my words came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> D. Andr. printers, or himſelfe. And whereas D. Andr. excepted, that this conſolation were to no purpoſe, becauſe he that was afflicted might doubt, whether this ſunne would euer riſe or not: I anſwered to him, that which the printers haue quite left out, and which I will now therefore more fully repeate. I was wont therefore to tell the party thus troubled, after he had forſaken his falſe and deueliſh poſition: that although an externall vocation were not of force enough to appeaſe an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted conſcience, yet it was of ſufficient force and efficacie againſt the deuill. For I tell him that they which neuer had external nor internal calling, they (if we regard an ordinary caling) muſt needs periſh: but whoſoeuer is once called, he hath ſet as it were his foot in the firſt entry into the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of heauen:
<pb facs="tcp:5274:167"/>
and vnleſſe it be by his owne default, he ſhall come afterward into the courtes of God, and ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees into his Maieſties pallace. And for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this, I vſe diuers waies. For why, ſay I, doubteſt thou of his good will towards thee, who in mercy hath ſent me a miniſter to call thee vnto him? thou haſt no cauſe, vnleſſe thou alledge the number of thy ſinnes. If this be all, why, oppoſe the infinite greatnes of Gods mercy againſt thy ſinnes, who hath ſent me to bring thee vnto him. The Lord vouchſafeth to bring thee into the way of the elect, why art thou a ſtumbling block vnto thy ſelf? and refuſeſt to followe him? If thou feeleſt not as yet inwardly in thy ſelfe to be ſtirred forward, pray that thou maieſt be. Know this for a moſt ſure trueth, that this deſire in thee is a pledge of Gods fatherlye good will towards thee. He neither can, nor will be wanting to this which he hath ſtirred vp in thee. After theſe exhortations, I ſhew him, how ſome are called at the eleuenth houre, how the Gentiles, after many thouſand yeeres were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be Gods people, how the theefe was ſaued vpon the croſſe: theſe and many other remedies I vſed, whereof, I neuer remember that I repented me.</p>
            <p>But If I deale with ſuch as haue before obeyed the Lords calling, and either by reaſon of ſome gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinne into which they haue fallen, or becauſe they haue abſented themſelues from the Church of God, or in that they, refuſing publike and priuate admonitions, haue bene offenciue to the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:5274:168"/>
or, which in mine experience, hath befallen many very good and godly perſons, whileſt they ſatiſfie not themſelues, they are ſo altogither buſilie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant in reprehending and iudging themſelues, that they for a while forget the mercy of God, with theſe, to omit ſuch as for ſome naturall infirmities, are, if they procure not ſpeedie helpe of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Miniſter moſt daungerouſlye tempted, with theſe (I ſay) I vſe this order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I deſired, that they intimate vnto me, that which eſpeciallye greeueth them, and as I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand both the thing, and meaſure therof by them: I take eſpeciall care of this, that they being already ouermuch caſt down, that I then, by the ſeuere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the Lawe, doe not quite ouerturne them: yet ſo, as that I doe not altogither withdraw them either from condemning their former ſins, or the meditation of Gods Iudgement: And ſo, as much as I can, I temper the words of conſolation, as that I nothing cloake Gods anger againſt them for their ſinnes.</p>
            <p>After I haue thus prepared the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I then demaund, whether they haue bene euer in this caſe, or no? Nay, (ſay they for the moſt part) the time was, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was in great ioy and peace of conſcience I ſerued the Lord, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was I an vnhappie perſon, ful of faith, full of hope: But now wretch that I am, I haue loſt my firſt loue, and there is nothing vexeth me more then to remember thoſe times paſt. But (ſay I) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration is more greeuous vnto thee, the apprehenſion of Gods iudgments, or the diſlike of
<pb facs="tcp:5274:168"/>
thy ſelfe, that thou ſhouldeſt offend ſo gratious and ſo louing a father? Both, ſay they, but eſpecially the latter. Therfore (ſay I) ſinne alſo diſpleaſeth thee in that it is ſin, namely, becauſe it is euil, and God who is goodnes it ſelfe, is offended with it? It is euen as you haue told vs (ſay they) and I am now aſhamed that ſo vile and wicked a wretch as my ſelfe, ſhould come before ſo gratious &amp; merciful a father. Then I tell them, that no man is offended, but rather is glad when he can iniury one whom he hateth: this they graunt, and withal ſay. God forbid, that albeit the Lord hate me, I in like ſort ſhould hate him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom if it were poſsible, I would be reconciled again. Then I ad this: Be of good comfort my deer brother, you are in good caſe. For who can loue God, eſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was wounded by him, who can bewaile the loſſe of his freendſhip, who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to come againe into his fauour, but he, whome God ſtill loueth, although for a time he be angry with him? except peraduenture you haue not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thus much, that the knowledge of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commeth not from fleſhe and bloud, but from God himſelfe, who firſt vouchſafeth to inſtruct vs, and from Chriſt Ieſus, manifeſting the father vnto vs: and that is Gods bleſsing, that we do loue God, who loued vs firſt when we were his enemies. You haue therfor (my good brother) iuſt cauſe why you ſhould be greatly diſpleſed with many things paſt, but ther is no cauſe why you ſhould deſpair. Briefly you haue inwardly, &amp; as it were dwelling with you euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teſtimonies of your reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with god:
<pb facs="tcp:5274:169"/>
eſpecially if you ceaſe not to pray vnto him earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who hath laid <hi>the foundation of repentance in you, to wit, a diſlike of ſinne, and a deſire to be reconciled vnto him.</hi> The ſheepe which wandred out of the folde ceaſed not to be a ſheepe, albeit it went a ſtraye for a time: you now are that ſheepe, to whome that faithfull Shepheard of all thoſe ſheep which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath committed to him, leauing thoſe ninetie and nine, doth not ſo much by our miniſterye, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he ſeeketh you, as hauing already ſought you, though you, not ſeeking him, hath indeede found you. <hi>Knocke</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and it ſhalbe opened vnto you.</hi> And haue you now forgotten thoſe promiſes, which were ſo often made to them that repent? and alſo which they had experience of, who in the ſight of the worlde were in a deſperate caſe? But I, ſaith he, againe, feele no motions of the Comforter, I haue now no ſence of faith, or hope: but I feele all the contrarie. Nay, ſay I, you deceiue your ſelfe, as I tolde you before. For it is the comforter alone, which teacheth you to hate ſinne, not ſo much for the puniſhment, as becauſe it is euill and diſliketh God, albeit he ſhew not himſelfe ſo fully at the firſt: becauſe you had ſo manye waies greeuouſly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, as that he ſeemeth for a while quite to forſake you. And, that you haue not qutte loſt him, but that he is as yet in ſome ſecret corner of your ſoule, from whence at your inſtant praiers he will ſhew himſelfe vnto you, this will plainely declare vnto you, which I now admoniſh you of the ſecond time. But let vs graunt as much as you ſay: yet, ſure
<pb facs="tcp:5274:169"/>
it is, that your faith was not dead, but onely poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a ſpirituall lyturgie. You liued in the wombe of your mother, and there were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of your life. A drunken man, although he loſe for a time the vſe of reaſon, and alſo of his limmes, yet he neuer looſeth reaſon it ſelfe. You would think that in winter the trees were dead, but they ſpring againe in the Summer ſeaſon. At night the Sunne ſetteth, but in the next morning it riſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And how often ſee we by experience, that he which at one time took the foile in a combate, at another did win the price? And know this, that in the ſpirituall combate of the fleſh with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the like we may ſee in manye, partlye by reaſon of the weakenes of our nature, partlye through ſloth to reſiſt, and partlye for default to beware. To theſe he replyeth, for ſuch temptations are hardly remoued, I would to God (ſaith he) I could perſwade my ſelfe that theſe promiſes belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to me. For my preſent eſtate conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me to doubt, whether I am the childe of God, or no.</p>
